    name: "Sub Rosa"
    preamble: "<blockquote>&quot;Airwaves allow for a silence that is not dead, representing a presence even wthout a signal&quot;</blockquote><p>Dockstader has given up tape manipulation in favour of working with frequencies and computer composition. Unlike the cycle of 1960-65, these pieces no longer rely on interruptions, accumulations, and complex acceleration effects. Instead, we have slow, penetrating pulses that explore every corner with celestial thrills.</p><p>Sub Rosa released Tod Dockstader's Aerial in three installments during 2005, the first of which came with a cardboard sleeve in which to collect the remaining releases.</p>"

In fact everything but the LP labels and the LP itself. But almost immediately people wanted the missing element so Creel Pone began including the music inside the sleeve on a CD-Recordable. This makes the Creel Pone more expensive to produce than they are sold for; but really it's not about having anything to do with money but just a way for pure and great art both in vision &amp; sound to prosper and be discovered anew.&rdquo;<br><a href=\"https://keithfullertonwhitman.com/creel-pone\">Creel Pone editions</a></p>"
