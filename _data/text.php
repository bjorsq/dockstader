So there is genre and the sound of silence and our enthusiasm becomes muted behind a self-perceived lack of knowledge that is always uttered by experts. We are disqualified by history. However, to be self-consciously working in 'history' is to be nothing other than to be too closely affixed to the demands and expectations of the present. Instead of this instant contemporaneity, an infamy that is often mediated and emphatically 'new',  sound-mavericks like Dockstader, following a laborious and singular vein of experimentation, seem to fall into a space that is neither musical nor traditional, neither past nor present.",
                    "Listening to Dockstader is like listening to an event as it unfolds for the first time. It is not to eavesdrop on a institutionalised and monologic music of the past,  but it is to embrace a form of musical polyphony that does not reduce the &quot;diversity of time&quot; to the hierarchic dimension of originators and imitators. With Dockstader we are invited to listen to sound as it emerges in its materiality: a present becoming the future by way of the past. A reclaimed history. Most of all, as listeners, Dockstader makes sure that we are eminently qualified in that the basis of his experimentation is the basis of our own experimentation as listeners:  we too work &quot;directly with the sound&quot; in our ears.Listening is time regained."

                    "The extent of Dockstader's experimentation with sound can be gauged by the fact that in the early 60s, when much of his work was 'constructed', there was no instant means of categorising such work. This was made more the case by Dockstader's straddling of the popular and high art cultural zones: working on the production of cartoons and sound-effects whilst scoring a Fellini film and having his pieces played alongside those of Var&egrave;se. Yet, in the mid 60s such 'musique concrete' experiments were more or less a very fragmentary and dispersed form a minor subset of avant-garde classical music. The centre of gravity may have been Schaeffer's Groupe de Recherche Musicales and there may have been other nodal points like John Cage's Fontana Mix and Steve Reich's Come Out, but what seems to be inflected in Dockstader's work, like that of Var&egrave;se, is just this sense of isolation and difference from the 'canon' of electronic music as it was becoming conscious of itself and establishing its paradigms.",
                    "Just as Var&egrave;se transformed the common conception of the orchestra, pulling it towards a liberation of timbre and rhythm, Dockstader's tape-splice music, by making 'noise' multifariously rich and organising it into highly spatialised compositions, not only insulates itself from being seen as a historic novelty, but presences its 'process' approach as running concomitant with the listener's own exploration of the sounds. Dockstader makes 'process' audible as that which actively resists becoming identified as the canon. To echo Morton Feldman, Dockstader's approach is a case of &quot;vibrant musicality rather than musicianship&quot; and this lack of a self-conscious aspiration to create a music of the canon is audible in Dockstader as the setting free of sounds rather than their being marked by the personality of the 'composer' or the 'musician'.",
                    "To say it is an idiosyncratic approach, one that multiplies the points of difference between categories, making the boundaries fuzzy, is something of an understatement. Dockstader's obsessive means of composition forms a direct link to the obsession of listening where a sense of focus and heightened attention is intimately operative. There is a sense of rapture induced  by detail and an infusion of common objects with a poetic resonance that outstrip their 'real use'. Thus  Dockstader's inclusion of such common objects as balloons and water as source-sounds for his pieces becomes translated into a sense of listeners not only being freed from traditional notions of 'instruments' and 'composers', but also their being given the option to hear music everywhere. Dockstader thus implies that music should be able to be constructed from any elements and, as with punk, needs only to be fuelled by the desire to express.",
                    "Thus we listen on Dockstader's terms, terms that our own in that they are premised by a more egalitarian ethos than that which attends on a normative classical tradition: the institutionalisation of reception. Dockstader, in succeeding to liberate himself from the need to make music via notation or by access to an orchestra and the sense of 'schooling' that this implies,  by using and transforming such objects as balloons, brings the production of music much closer to those very listeners who would formerly be seen, condescendingly, as the 'audience'. His is a music on the interstices of time. On the interstices of expectation.  On the interstice of listener and producer."

                    "However what informs Dockstader's (dis)positioning in relation to the classical tradition and even to that of 'musique concrete' is the sense that he is not afraid of creating pieces of music that can at times function in a more popular register. This is not to offer such work as Travelling Music as pop music, but it is, in using the hindsight of the techno of the 80s and the electronica of the 90s, to read Dockstader backwards: to listen to his pieces as if they had just occurred. When we do this we not only come face-to-face with the 'engineer as musician' but when we contrast the cleanliness of digitalised technology to the timbre-mix in Dockstader's work (enhanced by his composed use of the spatial dimension of music) we come across a further use of sound as singularised rather than as preset or mass-produced.",
                    "Whereas the popularisation of electronic music through techno has prepared us to dispense with notions of 'acoustic' being read as 'authentic' and where we may be accustomed to the use of sub-bass (cf. Luna Park) what we are not prepared for is Dockstader's creation of electronic timbres out of almost nothing. Not having access to synthesisers what Dockstader achieves is the building of his own 'personalised' synthesiser by the merging of tone generators with found and transformed sounds and then composing his pieces directly onto tape. Another divergence from techno-orthodoxy is that there is an improvisatory feel to Dockstader's pieces: &quot;moving around, working with your hands, sometimes very fast, more often very slowly... it had a muscular joy... teetering between control and chaos, trying to push the sound a little father forward&quot;.",
                    "Dockstader compares his working methods to those he employed in his early years as a painter and what comes across, what gives the music this sense of immediacy and emergence, is just this 'live' quality of the pieces where, as with improvised music, there is the imbrication of form and content: a precarious balance between organising the sound and letting the sound disorganise the composition. Thus, through all parts of the process it is as if the intensity of Dockstader's pieces are a direct outcome of the lack of any mediating device between the sounds, his listening into them and the finished piece we listen into. No screen. No software. No baton. No score. Sounds are neither softened nor made palatable, they are not organised into compositions that make the sounds operate figuratively, but are composed in a way that makes sound audible as a non-narrative process.",
                    "Apocalypse (Part 2) with its use of 'various doors' and a 'Gregorian chant' seems to depict Dockstader in the process of doing everything possible to continually transform his source. This reflexive technique thus raises a use of repetition and it is this aspect that could be seen as another way that his music is different from the traditional approach of musique-concrete. Pieces such as Apocalypse and Quatermass both use the same sources repeatedly and in so doing they inflect the music, not with a repetitious edge, but with a cinematic atmosphere that is creative of a sustained and portentous mood. The Tango piece (and others from Quatermass) also use steady rhythms more readily than other musique concrete electronic/tape constructions. This is also audible during Drone where a repeating bass motif is briefly held-out to feed-forward towards a moment of meta-funk. Once more this points to an appreciation of Dockstader from the vantage point of a more populist approach the 60s pop producer Joe Meek, though intent on record sales, was similarly involved in the possibilities of the music studio and his I Hear A New World concept album bears some resemblance to the more architectonic and finely detailed work of Dockstader. But Meek was mainly interested in enhancing the sound of ballad-singers and beat-groups and did not resist &quot;forcing the sounds too far into music&quot;.",
                    "So whilst both Meek and Dockstader both used tape-phasing techniques to create a 3-D effect through echo it is with Dockstader that sound-processing comes to the fore. Sound for sound. Sound as desire. Desire in perception. A group of singular emergences."

That Dockstader's experiments had to cease because of his &quot;lack of academic credentials&quot; may have had the bonus effect of burying and preserving his work, making it seem like an unintentioned accident that, not being 'overcoded' and allotted its place in 'musical knowledge', is thus always open to rediscovery by any that stumble across it. Thus it is a music that is always liable to retain something of the vitality and passion that was initially injected into it. For what is communicated in the work of Dockstader is the sense that conformity to categories and expectations is a way to diminish our desire to listen and thereby to repress the continual process of singularisation as it remakes itself through the obsessive pursuit of sounds in transformation.",

When I got the use of a two-track recorder, I used this piece, instead of doing a new work, so I could concentrate on teaching myself the techniques of placing sound in space (between speakers) and moving it through space - hence the title (Jackie Gleason, in his black-and-white TV days, used always to ask the pit-band conductor for &quot;a little travelling music&quot; to help him move across the stage)."

It is chaotic yet surgically precise, otherworldly in its sound and scope yet unmistakably the product of human innovation and discovery. It is most of all a challenge to the musical form - Dockstader eschews traditional melody, harmony and rhythm - but in cutting, pasting and manipulating recorded sounds he evokes genuine drama and emotion, properties that distinguish the finest music regardless of its origins and elemental makeup.",
                "Born March 20th, I932 in St. Paul, Minnesota, Dockstader worked for animation production houses UPA and TerryToons before accepting a job at New York City's Gotham Recording Studios. There he created <em>Eight Electronic Pieces</em>, first privately issued and later picked up by Moe Asch's Folkways Records in I96I. Subsequent efforts including <em>Luna Park</em>, <em>Apocalypse</em> and the epic <em>Quatermass</em>, followed. Dockstader operated, in large part, outside the sphere of the music world record labels commonly rejected his efforts, and his attempts to join the famed Columbia-Princeton Canter for Electronic Music were summarily dismissed. In the wake of the agonizing <em>Omniphony</em> project he stopped making music altogether.",

                "I had a regular Depression-era childhood. It was very ordinary. My only experience with music was the radio, because in those days, there was a lot of music on the radio. Classical music. Serious music. That's where I started to listen. I was interested in radios-how they worked and magic like that. It was an odd combination: I was fascinated by the electronics of the radio, and I liked serious music. When I was 12 or 13, I got a federal license, and I was a radio amateur for a while. So I learned electronics that way - it was all tubes and all very primitive.",
                "I went to public school, and then I went to the University of Minnesota, so I was exposed to a lot of good live music because of the Minneapolis Symphony. It was a quiet time - we went right from the Depression into the war. I had three majors: I was majoring in Art, English Lit and Psychology, particularly Abnormal Psychology. I was interested in thought and the brain, and Abnormal Psychology was a great way to study it because of the extremes - what goes wrong tells you a lot about the process of thought. I almost got nabbed for Korea, but I managed to weasel out. I got a psychiatric 4-F. I'd had allergies all my life, so I went to the guy who had treated me most of my life and he had saved all my records and he was very much against the war so he wrote up a sealed document that I presented to the inspectors at the exam. The Army would have driven me nuts if I hadn't already been nuts.",
                "After I left the university, my wife and I went out to L.A. We just got in an old car and drove. My wife taught school, and in a way, I supported us by doing cartooning for all kinds of trade publications. Whatever they wanted illustrated, I would illustrate. Then I decided I wanted to make movies. Everybody does, out there. The way it is now, you can major in film and get real experience, but in those days there wasn't any of that. I had a portfolio of my cartoons, and I carried that around with me, so I went to Disney Studios and they were looking for somebody to work in the sub-sub-sub-sub-basement, filing ancient film cels: the celluloid stuff that cartoons are based on. They said, 'Leave your book here with the secretary, and it will be here when you come back.' When I came back, my book was gone, and it turned out some animators came by and they said, 'Who is this? Send him to our place when he comes back.' So I talked to them and they said I should go to UPA, that I'd die at Disney. There was a director at UPA called T. Hee and he was doing the 'Mr. Magoo' stuff. I went over and he looked at my book and said, 'I'll tell the manager to hire you.' UPA had a little ad in The Hollywood Reporter looking for editors, and that's what I wanted to do - I thought if I could get into editing, that was the way to get to be a director. I had already made an appointment to apply for an apprentice editor job, and the manager said 'Wait a minute, you're supposed to be here tomorrow for the editor's job, and here you are now and you're an animator.' I said, 'I'd rather be an editor,' so I edited film.",
                "I was at UPA for about a year and a half. The studio went upside-down: They went into television and failed miserably. The only thing that happened out of all that is I learned to edit film, and part of that in those days was optical tracks - the sound was optical. As it turned out, learning to edit film and to mix soundtracks was the first training I had in sound. From there I went to TerryToons in New York. The guy who ran TerryToons, Gene Deitch, wanted to save money on soundtracks, which were costing him a lot of dough, so he asked if anyone knew how to run a tape recorder. I started doing tracks for him, and that was the first time I worked professionally in sound. I had to teach myself, because no one there knew how to do it. By day I did storyboards, and at night I did soundtracks.",
                "I saved up some money, and I decided I'd write a play, write a novel, that sort of thing: Greenwich Village aspirations. I took time off and stayed home and wrote. Nothing went anywhere, and I said, 'Well, I'll go back to work.' But there was a recession, so I was living on unemployment for a long time. In order to get unemployment, you have to keep a log that you're looking for work, and I had nowhere to look-the animation had dried up. So I remembered my experience with tape at TerryToons, and I landed a job at Gotham Recording in New York City as an apprentice sound engineer. That's where the music started.",
                "I really enjoyed sound. There were a lot of funny sounds in radio that always fascinated me - squeals and peeps and beeps, all kinds of mysteries. I don't know why it fascinated me - it just did. Gotham wasn't a big music studio - it was really a medium sized factory. Very small studios and editing rooms. We were doing all kinds of taping for radio and commercials, training films, plays, whatever. We used a lot of sound-effects, and I just started saving sounds. I could store them, and with tape editing, I could do all kinds of things to them. It happened that at that time appeared the first Musique Concr&egrave;te - the Schaeffer &quot;Etudes,&quot; the little Toonerville Trolley train things, the saucepan songs. It was very modest and monaural, the things he was doing. That really interested me, but I thought the music was kind of ... dull. Extremely simple. And I never did like repetitive loops. But the fact that it was being taken seriously interested me, and so I thought, 'Maybe I can do something.' A composer, all he needs is a paper and pencil - you just write. But in this world that I was interested in, you needed some pretty heavy equipment - very expensive. I was lucky because I had this engineering job, and I was always willing to work at night, so they finally gave me a master key to the whole place. I would do the paying job as fast as I could, and then I would start wailing - doing my own stuff.",
                "So that's where the Eight Electronic Pieces came from. I'd record some sounds - water, wind, whatever made a noise - and then I'd go play with them in the editing rooms. At home, I'd put a microphone out the window when the wild cats were calling to each other, or, as I used to do in the apartment that I lived in, I would climb up into the elevator shafts and record the motors. You find sounds, you see. And that's your raw material. It's more or less random - it's a matter of luck finding sounds, and walking around with your ears open. From doing the work, then you get selective, and you know 'No, that's no good, that's not going to work, but that's a good sound, and I can use it.' It's from doing it and failing, and then remembering the color the sounds have in them for what I needed to make a piece. It's a matter of going around and tapping on things. I remember I'd spend time at dimestore toy counters, because they had little noisemakers. Halloween was a great time to find stuff, too. I'd listen to it and I'd imagine because I knew what I could do with it. In my mind I could pitch it down or pitch it up or imagine running it backwards -  I'd done so much of it that I had kind of a cerebral circuit, like a preview. I'd just collect all these things, and I'd get favorites, and then I'd look for sounds that would go with those favorites. And that's when the piece would start to form- when I started to get judgmental.",
                "Why I chose the sounds I did, I really do not know. I liked dramatic music - I liked modern as opposed to classic. I liked jazz, and I liked eccentric music. I don't remember thinking this at the time - it's all in retrospect - but I went for dramatic sounds, dark sounds, something with some theater in it. To me it was all finding out - I had no preconceived ideas. I was working intuitively. I just wanted to make some music that I liked, and this was the only way I knew how to do it because I happened to have a background in the technology of recording. In those days, there were no synthesizers - it was just tape recording. I'd just start things going and see what happened. I'd wait for something good, and I cannot tell you why I decided something was good or something was bad. I was in it, but I was not predetermining anything. I had no goal. I just wanted to make something I liked. I just listened, and if it seemed to work and seemed to move and the tempos were good and there were good surprises and it had an atmosphere, then I kept it. A lot of times it just wouldn't work, but it worked enough.",
                "The first seven pieces were on 7 - and - 1/2 IPS tape, and it seemed to be working, so I took it seriously and did 15 IPS, which is the professional speed, and I think that was on Number Seven or Eight. In New York at that time, FM radio was much more adventurous than it is now - even staid stations like WQXR, which is the New York Times station, would play some pretty adventurous music, and some of this musique concr&egrave;te was appearing on the air. I knew how to make lacquer masters, so I made 50 pressings - I could do it cheaply, because I was an engineer so I got discounts. I sold them door - to - door and sent them to every record company in New York or anywhere, and the only one who responded was Moe Asch at Folkways.",
                "I did want people to hear it. I wasn't in a cave someplace. I wanted them to hear what I was doing because I liked it, and I thought maybe somebody else would too, just as I liked other people's music. I did everything could, but nobody took it. I was outside the circles. I didn't know anybody in music at all. I had no correspondence with anyone. I was considered a primitive, you know, kind of a joke - somebody who just did this stuff. And then I just quit - I just disappeared. There was an orchestral work called 'Omniphony' It was an expensive thing to do: I don't know how many people played - 25 musicians or something like that. Owl Records was a hobby of a wealthy fellow in Colorado. He funded the recording, and I had this collaborator - he transcribed some of my sounds. That was the whole idea. It was a lousy experience, and I stopped making music after that. I said, 'I don't want anything to do with music.' I just walked away I guess I'd done what I wanted to do.",
                "I worked for an industrial design company specializing in exhibits. For that kind of work you use everything - film, sound... it's a kind of Theater in that way. From that I went into business with another fellow from the Gotham days, and we started up a company, Westport Communications Group, and we did a lot of educational audio-visual work, starting out with filmstrips. We went from that into doing videos - I did a lot of American history videos for American Heritage. I wrote them and found the pictures - it was all archival material. It was a great job. I did that for years, and did very well in it.",
                "I had built a studio for the purpose of producing these audio-visuals. It was a mixing studio. So I had this equipment - a couple Ampexes, a mixing board, this, that and the other thing. The business went bankrupt, so instead of getting money, I just took the equipment as the liquidation, and I brought it home and put it in a little room. I still liked to do the work - I loved to put my hands on the tools. But I didn't have any of my original source materials because I destroyed them all in the bankruptcy - there was no place to store it all. I had hundreds of thousands of feet of tape, but I didn't want to do that kind of thing anymore, so I just started out from scratch. I thought, 'What can I use for an idea source?' I always need something. Sometimes it was a balloon, or a toy, or a faucet - there was some germinal thing that would start me thinking.",
                "In this case it was shortwave radio. One of the pieces of equipment that I had saved was an old analogue shortwave radio that I had used in one of the educational audio-visuals that I did - communications was the subject. So I turned on the radio and went back a million years to when I was very young and I became fascinated again with the potential of not the broadcast, but the atmospheric sound. In between the broadcasts or the signals there is sound - it's kind of electronic. It can sound like cosmic breathing. I remembered it from my days as a radio amateur - I was always interested not particularly in the broadcasts but some of the odd things between the broadcasts. You tune across and there are really miraculous sounds in the silence. I thought, 'I think I can do something with that.' It took me about ten years to do it, and now I've got about three CDs worth of stuff. I call it 'Aerial' - I always had to have a name first, because you pile up a lot of tape, and you've got to have a project name or everything gets lost.",

                "This is not &quot;pure&quot; electronic music in the German use of the term - not oscillator-music, synthetic music, laboratory music. It is not pure concr&egrave;te music - natural sound, transmuted by re-recording. It is a combination of both. The American term &quot;tape music&quot; covers it, but poorly. &quot;Tape music&quot; suggests any piece of music recorded on tape, the traditional use of tape. Here, there is no performance to preserve; the recording is the performance. These pieces can only be played by a phonograph or tape recorder. Without electronics, the electronics of tape recording, they would not exist. So they are electronic music in the technical sense that Var&egrave;se's &quot;Poeme Electronique&quot; is electronic music: a piece combining concr&egrave;te and electronic sources, dependent upon electronics for its realization. Although the Germans insist on the purity of their electronic music, Stockhausen's &quot;Gesang der Junglinge&quot; is a combination of concrete children's voices with oscillator-generated sounds - a combination that gives this piece a range of ideas his &quot;pure&quot; pieces do not have. This and the Var&egrave;se piece are the two major works so far produced (and available in disc release) in the medium, and both are combinations.",
                "Why combination? Each pure source has its limits and advantages: pure electronic sounds are often dry, harsh, sharp, limited in timbre, without much harmonic complexity. Concrete sound, while having a range of timbre as great as natural sound itself, tend, for reasons of the extensive re-recording they must go through, to lack cleanness and impact - the presence of pure electronic sound. Music must have both range and definition; in electronic music, a sustained piece calls for this combination. I use electronic sources for percussion, tempo, accent, and concrete sources for thematic and &quot;full orchestra&quot; passages. For instance, the eighth piece begins with a series of sustained bell-like sounds, over which a sharp snare-like tempo is laid. The bell sound is concrete; the drum, electronic. The source of the bells was a single hit on a saucepan; the drum was a single switch arc, reverberated into tempo by tape-echo. In the case of the arc, prolonged reverberation turns it into a flute-like flutter and this flutter is used, in various pitches and tempos, in several of these pieces. This is a simple example; in most  places it is impossible, and pointless, to sort out the sources as concrete or electronic. It is the <em>use</em> of them, the composition, on which the success of these pieces a music depends.",
                "In composing these pieces, I used a library of tape cells (sound units, such as a single pitched vibration, a piece of concretized wind, a passage of voice vibration) that grew to 12,000 feet of tape before the first composition was tried. In the early, exploratory pieces (numbered one to six), I simply started two reels of tape cells going and waited for a happy accident of combination. From the first &quot;happened&quot; theme, I proceeded to build the piece with more control, trying to keep it related to the first accident. Still, accident was responsible for much in these first pieces. In a medium as wide and unruly as this, where anything is possible, control becomes a major struggle, and a piece is not so much built as torn down into form. Some of these early pieces ran half-an-hour originally. As I went along, a gradual disenchantment with the cells set in; a cell had to work into the piece under way or it would be excluded, no matter how interesting it was as a sound by itself. This necessary familiarity with my cells is a continuing labor that goes on between compositions, as the collection of cells goes on between compositions, too. In electronic music, the composer is also not only conductor and performer - he is the musical director as well, charged with collecting an orchestra of thousands of instruments, remembering where each one is and how it sounds, and keeping each of these virtuosi under control.",
                "The new listener to this music will run into a major difficulty right away: identification. For instance, the listener whose first experience in electronic music was &quot;Forbidden Planet&quot; will have a hard time keeping science-fiction images from coming to mind. Along with this, he will probably be identifying some of the sounds he is hearing: &quot;That's a jet; that sounds like someone with a bad heart&quot;; or &quot;that sounds like my icebox.&quot; These associations take control of the piece, and put it into the realm of sound effects for the mind's eye, or, at best, program music like &quot;Peter and the Wolf.&quot; There is nothing wrong in this, as long as the listener can progress beyond it. In this apparent wilderness of strange sounds, such identifications will often be the only way the listener can begin to know the piece, or even stand it. However, if the novelty of a jet plane in a piece of music continues to be its chief interest for the listener, the piece has certainly failed him as music, that would be like playing the &quot;Pines of Rome&quot; only for the nightingale in it. This problem of &quot;significative noises&quot; (Stravinsky's term) will become less as electronic music is heard more, and as composers naturally come to use fewer such sounds.",
                "For me, the best use of electronic music is not in concerts, which are usually harrowing to sit all the way through, - nor with orchestras, where it suffers from the &quot;live&quot; vs. &quot;canned&quot; comparison - but in performance on the listener's own playback equipment. These pieces are meant for that use, are meant to be listened to close up. As with any recording, the better this equipment is, the more will emerge from the piece played. This is particularly true of electronic music, since the techniques of concretization often produce harmonies in the sub and supersonic frequencies - sounds that are more felt as a presence in the room than heard. The basic structure, however, is in the middle frequencies, and so these pieces can be explored on the simplest phonograph. The test of a small speaker playback is a good way for the composer, too, to explore the ideas of his piece; it's like writing out a quartet reduction of a symphony, to find out if there is a real structure to it, or if it's all just orchestration. This contention between the natural chaos of the sources-the anarchy of noiseand the realization of their order in a piece of music, is the tension and excitement of electronic music.",

                "The old battles over the use of the term <em>music</em> in <em>electronic music</em> have given place to new ones over the term <em>electronic</em>. Electronics are now generally accepted as a means to musical ends. But just what is 'electronic' and what is not is hotly argued by the composers now working in the technique. The Germans and Dutch have been insisting on the purity of their electronic music by using only oscillators as sound sources. To the French, such insistence on purity is a typically Germanic fanaticism; they prefer natural sound sources (<em>concrete</em>). The Americans have generally taken a middle ground, and this promises to be the most fruitful – a combination of oscillator and natural sources. The eight pieces in this album represent this combination. The fine 'Po&egrave;me &Eacute;l7egrave;ctronique' of Edgar Var&egrave;se is a combination in his 'Kontaktes.' So the combination technique suggests it may become the international style in electronic music, as the serial technique of composition has in orchestral music.",
                "Why combination? Each source of sound has its limits and advantages: pure oscillator sounds are usually dry, harsh, sharp, limited in timbre and without much harmonic complexity – they can, however, be controlled much more easily than natural sounds and can produce any tune the composer wants. Natural sounds have their own 'tunes' and are difficult to control, but they have a great range of timbre – just a dropped plate has all kinds of harmonics to explore. To realise these harmonics, however, a natural sound must usually be transposed electronically into a <em>concrete</em> sound. This process abstracts the sound enough to make it usable in a piece of music. Music that uses only these transposed sounds is called <em>Musique Concr&egrave;te</em> from the French, who claim to have invented it – although the first work in this technique was done in Russia long ago in the adventurous days of Formalism, before such activities were banned as not being in the public interest. This concretization of sound involves slowing down or speeding up the recorded sound through several generations of tape, filtering it, adding various kinds of echo - a process that often takes the bite out of it, so it lacks the cleanness and impact, the presence of pure oscillator sounds which can be used directly from the oscillator with little or no doctoring.",
                "Music must have both range and definition, and in a sustained electronic piece, both of these sources are needed. Each source has its own general sound, a perspective that becomes monotonous if unrelieved. Oscillator sound is usually small and close up – a string quartet sound - while concrete sound is usually large and distant, a little veiled. A simple example of both is to be found in the first part of the eighth piece on this record: the gong which starts the piece is a natural sound - a concretized saucepan hit – while the tempo series laid over it is electronic. In this case, the two different perspectives have been blended somewhat with added echo. Echo doesn't affect concrete sound much – such sounds have their own acoustics built in – but it does soften the sharpness and flatness of electronic sound, giving it a little 'room' to sound in. An example of this effect is the little oscillator tune which starts the first piece – without echo it would sound flat and dead. Thus, the electronic composer has to provide his own hall along with his own orchestra.",
                "In listening to this music, it is usually impossible, and most pointless, to sort out the sources as electronic or concrete. It is their use, their arrangement, upon which the success of these pieces as music depends. Var&egrave;se calls his electronic work <em>Organized Sound</em>, and the term indicates the importance of organization in this new music. The composer is confronted with a potential orchestra of thousands of instruments, and control is a major struggle. Building a piece is like improvising with a huge orchestra, recording as you go. Something starts, develops, and you're never sure of where it's going or how, even if, it will end. In the early pieces on this record (numbered in order of composition, one to six) I simply set two or three tapes of sounds going at once – chance combinations, accidental themes, chaos – all were recorded. Then I sat down and edited the half-hour result into three or four or five minutes, into something that seemed to be a 'piece.' This process led to a gradual disenchantment with the novelty of my sounds, and this disenchantment led to greater control from the start. A sound had to work into the piece under way, or it would be excluded before it got in. So, the seventh piece is much less cut up than the sixth was, and the eighth was not cut into at all, except to join the sounds and passages into a time relationship.",
                "I had 12,000 feet of taped sounds when I started my first piece; I now have four times that amount to work with. Existing as they do, at random on reels of tape, they are little more than a unique sound-effects collection. Only organization: selecting, mixing, cutting – can turn them into music. Electronic music must be listened to, finally, not for the novelty of its sounds, but for the sense of its composition – its ideas. The novelty will wear off in time for the listener as it did for the composer. If it doesn't, the piece has failed the listener as music, or he has failed the piece. If the novelty of a jet plane in a piece of music continues to be its chief interest for a listener, he has shut himself in with people who play the 'Pines of Rome' only for the nightingale in it. These new sounds <em>are</em> exciting, but they shouldn't obscure what the composer is trying to do with them. A composer working in this new way is taking chances, if he's any good. A composer who plays a traditional toccata on a square-wave oscillator, using it as a substitute for an organ, is taking no chances; much electronic music today is simply using new instruments to play old musical ideas, using the novelty of the new sound to make the piece 'modern.' But a composer who deals with wind, riflefire, water, jets, is flirting with chaos; the excitement of his music lies in his control of this near-chaos, as the excitement of Stravinsky's 'Sacre' is held in his control of an orchestra that constantly strains toward chaos. These new sounds demand new ideas from the composer willing to wade into unknown regions. It is appreciation of chances taken and results gained that the listener must try for.",
                "It seems unlikely to me that electronic music will ever replace the traditional orchestra, as come critics and composers have feared. Even when it has been designed to supplement the orchestra, it suffers in comparison with the live sounds, and the combination is usually cumbersome: the orchestra plays, then sits in resentful silence while a loud-speaker roars and whispers fuzzily. But the speaker can't roar as loudly or whisper as quietly as can the orchestra, and until tape recording and reproducing is improved dramatically, resulting in much wider dynamic range and signal-to-noise ratio, electronic music can't match, much less replace, the clear voice of the orchestra. Electronic music is recorded music – it exists only in a recording. The cuts on this record are not performances that have been recorded – they <em>are</em> the performances; you perform the piece when you play it on the phonograph. No recording of more than a few instruments can compare with the real thing. Electronic music can compare favorably only with other recorded music. The few successful combinations of electronic and live music have involved only a few live instruments, playing <em>with</em>, not in between, the taped sounds. Perhaps the future of recording – the use of thermo-plastics instead of magnetics, for instance – will change all this, but until then the orchestra has nothing to fear from electronic music. The traditional orchestra still holds worlds of new sound for the composer willing to explore it. Webern's 'Six Pieces for Large Orchestras' has been around for over fifty years as an example of such new exploration, yet few composers have even tried to duplicate the adventurousness of this work.",
                "Perhaps the orchestra itself is responsible for its fears of obsolescence. A large orchestra is a conservative body; it is governed and administrated. New works submitted to it by unknown composers must pass a long gauntlet of administrators before acceptance for performance – a discouraging process for young composers who want to work on a large scale. Most of the new music being performed today is chamber music, sometimes involving only a solo percussionist. So, too, it is difficult for the new composer, whose ideas are unorthodox, to get his work recorded. Record companies, with a few brave exceptions, release only oft-performed works: the catalogue lists eleven collections of Kreisler, two of Var&egrave;se, one of Webern. Electronic music offers a way out of this stalemate: the new composer can compose – record – perform (one process) works of large scale and unorthodox ideas. He becomes administrator and conductor; the performance will match exactly his concept, and there are no worries about other interpretations. All that stands in the way to realisation is the technical aspect. But this is a mountainous difficulty for most composers; put them in a room with a lot of machines and they only want to get out. But the machines can be learned in a much shorter time than it took the composer to learn the techniques of traditional music. The composer who wants to do an electronic piece must either become also a good technician, or have the assistance of a creative technician – and there are more of these around than most composers think. Many of the best mixers and tape editors in recording studios are also musicians who read and know music. And the composer who begins his work with a technician can, if he will learn as they go along, soon be doing his own mixing and editing. This new man – the composer-technician – is in the best position to realize the full potential of electronic music, and the control so necessary to the work.",
                "Europe has been quicker to realise aid to composers who want to work in electronics than has America. Electronic works are often commissioned by radio stations and record companies, who supply their facilities and technical assistance to realise the commissioned piece. NWDR and Deutsche Grammaphon in Germany, Philips in Holland, RTF in France – all have been assisting composers with electronic works for years. But in America this kind of aid is difficult, if not impossible, to come by. With the only electronic center – that at Columbia University – limited in its ability to accommodate more than a selected few composers, the independent composer must turn to record companies and radio stations for facilities – and these have shown no interest in such sponsorship. Yet here they have a unique opportunity to originate new music for air or disc. In the same way an orchestra commissions new works for live performance in its hall, they can commission works for their station or record label, works that would exist in no other way – and as aid, they can offer use of facilities they already have. In my own case, I had use of the facilities of the Gotham Recording Corporation in New York City, and as composers acknowledge more traditional grants and aids, I would like to acknowledge the aid this studio has given me toward realising these eight pieces.",

To find an equivalent sound that would be &quot;playable&quot; - more controllable - I recorded a lot of sustained tones on an acoustic guitar, &quot;Dopplering&quot; them with tape speed changes. But, in use it all became, for me, boring. It was the sort of sound that later became the material for minimalist music. So, in the process of working on it, the cars just drove away, though some of the guitar survived, along with the title. The <i>musical</i> impetus for the piece was Japanese court music, Gagaku, which I'd heard a lot of and liked. I tried to combine that sort of sound with some violence - the violence I felt that was lurking, almost unheard, under the restraints of Gagaku.

It was my antidote to the preceding <i>Water Music</i> - a work of small details, delicate textures, and some playfulness. The title was chosen because the word <i>sounded</i> right for the work. It happened to be the name of Professor Bernard Quatermass, star character of a 1950s BBC-TV science fiction serial and two B films (<i>The Creeping Unknown</i> [1956] and <i>Enemy from Space</i> [1957]); at the time, I hadn't seen them.",
                "The basic sound source in <i>Quatermass</i> is a balloon (By stretching the neck of an inflated balloon, you can change the pitch of the escaping air, it becomes a double-reed instrument). As with all my pieces, work began with collecting what I call &quot;cells&quot; (Schaeffer called them &quot;soundobjects&quot;): hours and hours of quarter inch tape recordings of whatever interested me, the original sound transmuted with (what are now called) &quot;classical&quot; tape-studio techniques. By the time I did &quot;Quatermass&quot;, I guess I had a library of around 300,000 feet of tape (125 hours at 15ips.). From this mass, I would select cells that seemed like they might work together into a piece, and then turn them into stereo (with more classical techniques of tape-delay and tape-echo between channels, panning, reverberation, and placement). For &quot;Quatermass&quot;, I had, for the first time, use of a <i>three</i>-track recorder (the third track filled the center &quot;hole&quot; in early stereo recording), which allowed me to do more complex tape-echo rhythms than before (heard in &quot;Tango&quot; and &quot;Flight&quot;) and thicker sound-masses - the &quot;wall&quot; of sound I wanted for the piece.",
                "To mix all this together, I had a six-channel mixer (tubes), one mono, one 2-track, and the 3-track machines as feeds into a quarter-inch, 2-track recorder. That was it (the most elaborate setup I ever had) - no &quot;layering,&quot; just one-pass mixing to the master tape. All this was tube equipment with no noise reduction (I reduced tape hiss by using, for the first time, a free box of experimental low-noise tape from 3M and forcing the oxide with high levels of recording).",
                "The final (and longest) stage was to edit the mixes into the five movements (this was where the <i>Moons</i> were born). I'd guess the forty-six minutes of <i>Quatermass</i> were wrenched out of probably a dozen hours of mixed tape.",

The gong that ushered in the first song ushers out the second."

I constructed a lot of these loops, and started to mix them - and managed to create an early form of what became New Age music: restful, but, to me, dull. So, as I had with Drone, I threw out the score (but kept the title) and began to improvise, trying to find out how far I could push those three generators. The loops would have been much easier, as it turned out: almost every note had to be cut into shape, on tape: attacks, sustains, decays - my &quot;envelopes&quot; were hand-made with a razor blade and a steel straight-edge, and so much splicing tape that the original tape is often entirely white. The tapes were finished just about the time that the first &quot;personal&quot; synthesizers became available, along with sequencers - and all that work was instantly made obsolete.

                "Omniphony is a pioneering work in musical composition. Never before have modern recording techniques been used to shape the content and form of instrumental music, nor have the elements and techniques of electronic with those of instrumental composition. Previously, works for tape and orchestra such as Var&egrave;se's <em>D&eacute;serts</em> and Stockhausen's <em>Kontakte</em>, were designed for concert hall performance, the tape playing simultaneously with the orchestral performance. The techniques of electronic composition that produced the tape were not applied to the orchestra and the acoustics of the concert hall prevented the orchestra and taped sounds from being blended perfectly. However, in Omniphony, the range, timbre, dynamics, and natural durations of the orchestral sounds have been expanded through electronic means and therefore have a new and common ambiance with the non-orchestral sounds.",
                "The work was completed in May, 1967 but was begun over four years earlier. Two composers conceived, wrote and executed the work, their talents being inextricably bound together in its composition. In 1963, Tod Dockstader composed a set of taped sounds which he called &quot;cells.&quot; They were both natural sounds (those that move the air, e.g. bells, wind, voice, etc.) and electronically generated sounds (modulation that goes directly to tape, as from oscillators, recording circuitry, etc.). James Reichert then familiarised himself with the cells, and composed a series of instrumental parts which were based upon the sound intentions of Dockstader's cells. But they could not proceed any further without recording the instrumental parts. Three years and many foundations later, the recording of these &quot;inparts&quot; was commissioned by Owl Records.",
                "The session took place in March 1966 at the Gotham Recording Corporation studios in New York City. After the orchestral recording, those inparts originally composed for the purpose were transmuted through the facilities of the independent Electronic Music Center at Trumansburg, New York, using R.A.Moog music processing equipment. Specifically, this transmutation meant changing the sound of the inparts by expanding or compressing instrumental ranges and dynamics, and by adding to, or reducing, the natural harmonics of the instrumental sounds. Now, Omniphony consisted of over 100,000 feet of tape, all of which was then edited and organised into four classifications: pure instrumental sounds, electronically transmuted instrumental sounds, natural sounds, and pure electronically generated sounds.",
                "Next came the mixing of these sounds, and again the facilities of the Gotham Recording Corporation were used. This last phase was the most important of all because it would be then, and only then, that Dockstader and Reichert would know if their adventurous concepts would materialise into a valid musical work of major proportions, or just an experimental curiosity for hi-fi buffs. A year later they finished the re-composition. This recording of Omniphony is the premiere and only performance of their work.",

                "I've written before of my interest in shortwave radio, in the notes to the Quatermass CD. Also, in the notes to the Omniphony CD (which has my first 'Aerial' mix, '<a href=\"compositions.php?page=13\">Past Prelude</a>' in it), I mentioned 'The Aerial Etudes', which was my working title for what became the three CDs you have. And, at the end of an <a href=\"interview.php?interview=2\">interview with Chris Cutler</a> (which can be found in the 'Unofficial TD Website'), the piece I mentioned was starting to work on at the time became 'Aerial'.",
                "When I was very young, people got most of their entertainment from radio. They called it 'playing the radio', as if it were a musical instrument. That's what I've tried to do in this piece.",
                "The mixing of the work began in 1990. Before that, I'd been collecting the sound-materials from an old shortwave radio I had. I worked at night because that's when the best reception occurs; during the day, short-wave sounds are limited and scarce - at least the kind I was listening for: the kind that occur when there are so many stations on the air, they over-ride each other and something strange emerges from the conflict.",
                "Because shortwave AM radio is of the lowest possible fidelity (little better than a telephone), I recorded on ordinary audio-cassettes. It was also for economy, because I knew I'd have to do a lot of recording to capture the momentary events I was looking for. Periodically, I would transfer the best (most potentially useful) of these recordings to quarter inch tape, turning them into 'hi-fi stereo' as I did, with a variety of techniques.",
                "Slowly, eventually, I made a library of 72 reels of tape and 35 DAT cassettes, for a total of about 90 hours of sound. Each track was given a descriptive name, and catalogued.",
                "I found that many of the tracks, though they were 'electronic' by nature, sounded not unlike the sounds I've used before in my work: bells, voices, drums, strings, trains, water, wind... And, in the mixing, I went for that physical sound.",
                "I began mixing in October of 1994. For this, I had two old Ampex 2-track tape machines and two, newer, DAT decks - giving me the possibility of eight tracks of feed. (This is the same amount I had for my 'Quatermass' and 'Apocalypse' LPs.)",
                "Everything was sent, analogue, to a third DAT: my first digital pieces (or parts of pieces). Eventually, I had 580 2-track mixes, on 16 DATs, and I was facing transferring the best of these back to analog tape, for final, physical editing - the old razor-and-splicing-tape technique, which was all I knew.",
                "About this time, a few people encouraged me to look into using a computer for this work. I'd never used one,  but I saw it would allow me to keep my mixes digital - no more transfer losses. So, at the end of 2001, I got a computer and an editing program for it, and spent what seemed a long time learning it. I began selecting mixes and loading them into the computer in late March, 2002. Out of the 580, I selected 90 'best' mixes - eventually reduced to 59, the ones on the CDs.",
                "I found the computer program I was using allowed me to deepen and expand the surprisingly 'acoustic' sound of many of the mixes: even 'choirs' e,erged, shouting voices, calliopes, detonations, whispers. So that the sound, as before in my work, dictated the form of each piece.",
                "Finally, in assembling the CDs, I followed David Myers' suggestion to allow each piece to flow into the next - making a continuous journey to the end.",

                "Tod Dockstader wanders down the fluorescent aisles of his local supermarket like a polite ghost. Self-contained and quiet of manner, you may not notice him at first amid the busy shelves and stacked freezer cabinets, but then some detail will catch your eye: his neatly pressed khakis, the knitted white sweater or the crisp Reebok touchline jacket he&rsquo;s wearing. At 73, he displays a casual elegance that allows him to both blend in and stand apart from the suburban sprawl that surrounds him in Westport, Connecticut, a quiet stop on the Metro-North Railroad about 50 miles out from New York&rsquo;s Grand Central Station.",
                "A couple of fire trucks race by outside, their sirens and horns blaring. He consults a handwritten list, peering closely at the items on it. &ldquo;Soda, bag of ice, spring water, KEN,&rdquo; run a few of the entries. &ldquo;I write a lot of lists,&rdquo; he explains. He sometimes finds he&rsquo;s lost track of which pair of glasses he should be wearing at any given time. He&rsquo;s also responsible for some of the most exciting electronic music you&rsquo;re likely to hear these days.",
                "&ldquo;To me it&rsquo;s just a continuation of what I&rsquo;ve been doing all this time, with long periods of nothing,&rdquo; he remarks casually of the two most recent releases to bear his name, then pauses to light up another cigarette from one of the two packs placed carefully on a side table close to where he&rsquo;s sitting on the back porch of his home. The sights and sounds of a fresh spring day in rural Connecticut filter easily in through the fine mesh screens. Out of those long periods of nothing to which he has just referred, however, has come <em>Pond</em>, a collaboration with David Lee Myers and the first new Dockstader work to be published in nearly 40 years, plus <em>Aerial #1</em>, part of a three-volume series of compositions derived from shortwave radio transmissions being made available as a part-work by Belgium&rsquo;s Sub Rosa label. Its scale and complexity, not to mention the painstaking technical skill with which each piece has been assembled, reveal a composer of unique talents and singular perception.",
                "&ldquo;Or a worker,&rdquo; Dockstader adds, recalling the resistance displayed in more traditionally minded musical circles during the 1960s towards his early compositions on magnetic tape. &ldquo;&lsquo;Composer&rsquo; has always meant notation, instrumentation. But yes, I compose what is and has always been, to me, music. Back then there was a great deal of conflict about the word &lsquo;music&rsquo;. Everybody went through this at the time. You know: &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this? Sounds like sound effects.&rsquo; But I was very clear on what I was doing. See, I came from a different background entirely than most of those people because they were all, you know, capital M musicians. I came from a background of film sound effects and studio engineering, so I thought of myself as a worker more than a musician with a capital M. I was just working in sound.&rdquo;",
                "It&rsquo;s a technical grounding, accumulated over the years, that still allows Dockstader to &ldquo;go directly into the sound and work with it&rdquo; in an age where quarter-inch magnetic tape has been replaced by the hard drive, and music, with or without its protective capital M, is being transmuted into a malleable onscreen presence, a stream of visible data. In fact, he seems right at home in such a period of transition. To create <em>Aerial</em>, for example, Dockstader used sound editing software to build up a selection of lo-fi recordings of shortwave signals made directly onto cheap audiocassettes into a vast, expansive work in both depth and scale. The source material for this project had lain around for some time as a series of two-track mixes until Dockstader&rsquo;s daughter finally persuaded him to buy a computer so that they could email each other. Prior to that, its potential as a compositional tool had left him fairly cold.",
                "&ldquo;I got some LPs of early computer music and it sounded so sterile,&rdquo; he recalls. &ldquo;To me the ideas were lacking. So you did it on a computer. You can&rsquo;t play the harmonica? Come on, let&rsquo;s make some mistakes here, let&rsquo;s make it live rather than this <em>ticking</em>.&rdquo; Dockstader&rsquo;s deep brown eyes flash and roll dismissively. He has always shown a preference for what he calls &ldquo;acoustic sounds&rdquo; - that is to say, ones that move through and inhabit auditory space. &ldquo;I like the way they breathe,&rdquo; he once remarked in an interview. Whether dealing with radio waves or frogs, his approach remains fundamentally the same. To create <em>Pond</em>, Dockstader swapped sound files with fellow composer David Lee Myers (Arcane Device), gradually transforming field recordings of local aquatic lifeforms into a teeming selection of exotically hybrid digital mutations.",
                "&ldquo;Myers had these recordings of frogs from some place in New Jersey,&rdquo; Dockstader explains, &ldquo;and I like frogs.&rdquo; He nods towards the bare expanse of trees and low sloping roofs beyond the back-porch screens. &ldquo;This was all swamp when we first came here, and it was filled with all kinds of frogs. We even had big muskrats running around. It&rsquo;s gotten very civilised now and I miss it. The frogs were wonderful. I listened to all their songs.",
                "&ldquo;<em>Aerial</em> was done and put away right before <em>Pond</em>. I do that a lot. I&rsquo;d get to a certain point and I&rsquo;d just be stopped or run out of steam, I don&rsquo;t know what happens. Then I&rsquo;d put it away and go on to something quite different just as a refreshment. We were doing <em>Pond</em> out of fun really, and I was learning computer as fast as I could go, you know. &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s throw a frog into it, because who cares if it eats it up or not? It&rsquo;s just a frog.&rsquo; We had a blast.&rdquo;",
                "Between them, <em>Pond</em> and <em>Aerial</em> exemplify an exacting approach to the compositional process that has remained a constant throughout Dockstader&rsquo;s long career. &ldquo;It might just be a fragment,&rdquo; he explains, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;d hear it and think, I can use this somehow. So I&rsquo;d collect these things and build them up and try to make them breathe. If I could hear exhalation, or something that moved me somehow, then I&rsquo;d go for that. I wanted them to sound alive. I always liked acoustic sounds. Still do. Even <em>Aerial</em> sounded acoustic to me, and when it didn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; he laughs, &ldquo;I pushed it.&rdquo;",
                "&ldquo;It&rsquo;s funny it took me so long to do a piece on radio,&rdquo; Dockstader remarks. &ldquo;I was practically born with a radio in my hand, thanks to the strange childhood I had.&rdquo; Growing up in St Paul, Minnesota in the 1930s, Dockstader suffered from an extreme form of eczema that often required whole summers to be spent in hospital, submerged in baths against possible infection, plus long hours passed alone in a darkened room, reading books and listening to the radio. &ldquo;I lived with that radio,&rdquo; he recalls, &ldquo;because that was the medium for the imagination. The radio then wasn&rsquo;t like we have now. In those days there were all kinds of stories, plays and the use of sound effects, music… that was a real world. That was my window.&rdquo;",
                "Dockstader still retains vivid memories of radio dramas presented by Orson Welles&rsquo;s Mercury Theatre and the 1937 CBS production of Archibald MacLeish&rsquo;s <em>The Fall Of The City: A Verse Play For Radio</em>, with music by a young Bernard Herrmann. &ldquo;Quite an amazing radio broadcast,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It had these choral effects in it and was about the world war to come, but without mentioning Hitler or anything. I never forgot that one. Although it was done live, it had that kind of roaring, receding sound, coming forward and going back.&rdquo;",
                "His observation recalls McLuhan&rsquo;s remark on radio&rsquo;s &ldquo;power to turn the psyche and society into a single echo chamber&rdquo;. The scale of its effect is intimate and overwhelming at the same time. As a small child in the 1930s, listening in the dark to broadcasts of speeches and rallies relayed directly from Nazi Germany, this descent into echoing choral antiphony was all too real. &ldquo;They&rsquo;d play these things when I was little,&rdquo; Dockstader explains, &ldquo;and I remember the terror not so much of the voices themselves, although they were pretty scary too, but the combination of the voices with the roaring that&rsquo;s on shortwave radio - these outer space sounds going on behind them, non-human, chiming in. That&rsquo;s where <em>Past Prelude</em> came from, my memory of that.&rdquo;",
                "Appearing for the first time on ReR&rsquo;s reissue of <em>Omniphony</em> - Tod Dockstader and James Reichert&rsquo;s legendary 1966 composition for chamber ensemble and electronic sounds - <em>Past Prelude</em> represented an early study on radio by Dockstader. A potent example of carefully constructed audio montage, it features a selection of Nazi songs and speeches caught up by the heavy surging of radio atmospherics and reduced to the murmuring roar of some vast invisible crowd. &ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t have many kids running off to listen to the Führer in St Paul, Minnesota,&rdquo; he laughs, shrugging off the memory; but the collection of vintage radios in his home testifies to a lifelong fascination that has been retained from earliest childhood.", 
                "&ldquo;I&rsquo;d lie with my ear stuck right by the radio so I wouldn&rsquo;t wake up my parents,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I was always fascinated when it went wrong. Most people would turn their radios off but I&rsquo;d leave mine on. Somebody would make a mistake, but there was still a presence I could hear. That interested me. I always thought radio was a great mystery; so <em>Aerial #1</em> is about some of that mystery, much more than parts two and three. <em>Aerial</em> to me is like going all the way back to the beginning, to some of the first sounds I heard on the radio.&rdquo;",
                "Often it&rsquo;s only when technology functions in an imperfect or imprecise manner that it truly begins to reveal itself. Tuning through an old radio dial put you in touch with the space between stations, a mysterious zone of harmonies and distortions that existed and functioned according to a strange and distinct logic. &ldquo;A lot of really funny things would happen,&rdquo; he concurs. &ldquo;You know, two stations would get off-frequency and their signals would start colliding, so you&rsquo;d hear something that sounded like a demented carousel or a pipe organ gone badly wrong. The old tube radios were very imprecise. We had a lot of storms in Minnesota, so you&rsquo;d have atmospherics that would come onto the frequency. Sometimes it was like a cosmic breathing or something.&rdquo;",
                "His fascination led the young Dockstader to become a ham radio enthusiast, building a tuner coil out of a Quaker Oats can wrapped in wire. Eventually he went on air with his own amateur broadcasts. The experience eventually led him to what he later described as &ldquo;the drama of sound&rdquo; and to the feel for technology he would need to work in the expanding magnetic field of electronic music.",
                "Shortly after World War Two, while he was still in high school, Dockstader first encountered the new phenomenon of magnetic recording. &ldquo;I was taking a class in physics,&rdquo; he remembers, &ldquo;and the teacher came in with a wire recorder, US army surplus, and he was trying to explain to us this new idea of magnetic sound. We were really interested. Then he said: &lsquo;Unlike any other recording, you can edit this. You can take out a word or you can put one in.&rsquo; The thing was, if you wanted to edit it you had to smoke cigarettes because of the thin steel wire,&rdquo; he laughs. &ldquo;You took the end where you wanted to make the join and you tied a square knot in the wire with the cigarette in your mouth glowing hot and at the precise time put the cigarette into the knot, which fused it. Otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t work. I was the only one in the class who smoked. You&rsquo;re not supposed to, you know, but I just happened to have some cigarettes and a Zippo lighter, so I became the owner of the machine as I was the only one who had perfected the technique.&rdquo;",
                "High school physics also introduced him to some of the earliest forms of recording tape. &ldquo;It was paper tape in those days,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Yeah, it was paper. There was a company in Minnesota called the Minnesota Mining Manufacturer, 3M, and they had all this rust, iron oxide, from the mining, and they were wondering what to do with it. They also made adhesive tape so they said, &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s sprinkle all this waste product on this paper with some gloop on it, and maybe this will be better than the wire, because we won&rsquo;t need to smoke and we can edit with a razor blade&rsquo;.&rdquo; Then the company tried testing their product on local communities. &ldquo;They were going around saying, Here&rsquo;s a tape recorder - tell us what you think.&rdquo;",
                "After studying painting and psychology at Minnesota University, Dockstader moved with his wife Beverly to Hollywood, where he found work at UPA in the 1950s, cutting picture and sound for the studio&rsquo;s animated cartoons, including the <em>Mr Magoo</em> and <em>Gerald McBoing-Boing</em> series. &ldquo;UPA were a bit more creative than the standard &lsquo;hit the cat on the head with the baseball bat&rsquo; feel - even with the sound they were really tired of the usual cracks, so it was, &lsquo;What can we do?&rsquo; Usually sound effects are from a library. You&rsquo;d go in and select them. If you needed a coconut here and a bop there, or if you needed an elephant sneezing…&rdquo;",
                "Yes, well, they didn&rsquo;t call the show <em>Gerald McBoing-Boing</em> for nothing; and since most libraries didn&rsquo;t cover such eventualities, other solutions had to be found. &ldquo;One of the other editors had worked as a drummer for Spike Jones and he&rsquo;d figure out what we needed,&rdquo; Dockstader continues. &ldquo;You know, boings and whatnot. He&rsquo;d put it right on optical and then we&rsquo;d mix that. It was all done very fast, because it was a small studio and very hard pressed by obligations that they just threw at us. We learned and made mistakes. It was really good.&rdquo;",
                "Increasingly imaginative storylines, plus the studio&rsquo;s constant demand to &ldquo;bring me something funny&rdquo;, forced the creative pace. &ldquo;Yeah, make it funny,&rdquo; Dockstader recalls. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s got to be funny and outrageous. So we&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;Well, let&rsquo;s try running it backwards and then mix it with something else.&rsquo; It was like making a kind of music. Magnetic sound was just coming in, but I was still working with optical sound, which you could read. So when someone on the soundtrack says, &lsquo;Tiptoe&rsquo;, you could see that the T is at frame 47 and the O is at frame 50.&rdquo;",
                "Being able to read and manipulate a visible representation of sound meant that Dockstader had little difficulty running some of the new editing software on his computer. &ldquo;Sound to me was waveforms and here it was again,&rdquo; he observes, giving a small whoop of pleased surprise. &ldquo;After all this time, there&rsquo;s the T, there&rsquo;s the O. I felt right at home right away… Yeeaah, of course. That&rsquo;s the way we did it. I was back in Hollywood, and it just came back to me naturally. It worked for me very, very well. I really enjoy it much more than when it was just tape.&rdquo;",
                "When Tod Dockstader speaks, his hands do most of the talking. While his voice keeps its soft register, his delivery remaining amiable and unhurried, punctuated by subdued exclamations and bright smiles, his long, slender fingers are busy folding and manipulating space. His arm gestures remain expressively graceful, alive with a wiry masculinity. They signal his enthusiasm: &ldquo;Wow, yeah.&rdquo; The only thing more animated is the constant play of astonishment and mild surmise in his eyes. &ldquo;A tape recorder is a musical instrument,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;It has keys and moving parts, and it&rsquo;s temperamental. You&rsquo;ve got to clean it all the time. You have to tune it - the bias must be just so. Every day you had to check the head azimuth. I was constantly aligning those heads, because they&rsquo;ll drift. The head gap has to be perfect or it mushes the sound, particularly the highs. It&rsquo;ll soften and blur them. So you start out every day, first thing is the alignment, and that&rsquo;s about half an hour, like tuning a piano.&rdquo;",
                "When UPA went out of business towards the end of the 1950s, Tod and Beverly loaded up their car and headed for New York, where Dockstader apprenticed as a studio engineer at Gotham Recording. It was also here that he first undertook the physical work of composing directly onto magnetic tape, using studio downtime to pursue initial experiments in the organisation of sound. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d do a lot of overtime. Night sessions,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;Everyone would go home, and I&rsquo;d stay and work on my own stuff in an empty building at night. I&rsquo;d use ends and half-reels of tape, stuff they&rsquo;d throw out, and splice it together.&rdquo;",
                "At UPA Dockstader had already started to &ldquo;hear music in sound: pitches, duration&rdquo;. But in the Gotham studios the plastic manipulation of recorded sound began in earnest. Gradually a first series of compositions, <em>Eight Electronic Pieces</em>, took shape. Working with open-reel tape was hard physical work, moving from machine to machine, coordinating playback, cutting and mixing individual tracks, hoping against hope that you had enough footage to realise an effect. &ldquo;You had to stand up to do it,&rdquo; Dockstader recalls. &ldquo;You couldn&rsquo;t sit down. It really was industrial, very physical. Like a ballet.&rdquo; He would later write of the process as having &ldquo;a muscular joy to it&rdquo;.",
                "Cutting across all abstract theorising, the recording had unequivocally become the score. Dockstader&rsquo;s early work was characterised not only by the precision and richness of the sounds, but also by the force with which the sounds come at you. <em>Study No 7</em> from <em>Eight Electronic Pieces</em>, first realised in 1961 (and now available on Locust Music), has a sense of attack that&rsquo;s rare for electronic work from this period. &ldquo;I always liked dynamics: the percussive,&rdquo; he remarks. &ldquo;I like to have edges. Sound to me is always very physical. I can feel, not just hear it. It has personality. It has weight, proportion. It&rsquo;s like I can pick it up and hold it. It&rsquo;s always been that way, I don&rsquo;t know why. It&rsquo;s not abstract at all. It exists. It isn&rsquo;t invisible to me.&rdquo; Westport&rsquo;s fire trucks go by again, unseen and unacknowledged in the far distance, their sirens and horns still blaring.",
                "Completed in 1963, Dockstader&rsquo;s <em>Water Music</em> brought form to the most formless of matter, combining recordings of running water, splashing and drips with sound produced on an ad hoc selection of objects, including a toy gong, Indian finger bells, a Coke bottle and a piece of sheet metal. It displayed an inventiveness that reached back to both his time cutting sound for UPA cartoons and to his days as an amateur radio enthusiast, converting old cigar boxes and germanium crystals into pieces of functioning equipment. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d just walk around,&rdquo; he replies when asked to describe the process of collecting sounds for <em>Water Music</em>. &ldquo;There was a sewer one night where I lowered a microphone down into it. The sounds came from all over. Just running a faucet, putting it through a trumpet, trying different mutes on it. I made little mutes to see what would happen to the drops scattering. It&rsquo;s affected by the depth, the height and velocity of the drips. I just kept on recording, recording, recording. I built a library. It&rsquo;s always been that way - start with some idea and just go out from there, searching for things that go with it or against it. It&rsquo;s hard to describe. It&rsquo;s kind of intuitive.&rdquo;",
                "<em>Water Music</em> had its premiere in June 1963 on FM music station WQXR as part of a programme that also featured Karlheinz Stockhausen&rsquo;s <em>Gesang Der J&uuml;nglinge</em>. At the end of the show, the presenter announced that since electronic music had no future, this would be the last broadcast of its kind. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll never understand that,&rdquo; Dockstader laughs, recalling the announcer&rsquo;s words. &ldquo;Why did they play it? I think the show was called <em>What&rsquo;s New In Music</em>.&rdquo; This particularly choice detail provokes another wave of laughter. &ldquo;In the end the whole programme died, although I don&rsquo;t think I was responsible for that.&rdquo;",
                "More likely it was the result of a general uneasiness over what music should be doing at that time. The high technical demands imposed by the production of these new sounds, together with the unprecedented structural possibilities they offered, brought with them an extended period of uncertainty. Did the tape recorder and the sound engineer foreshadow an end to music? Was John Cage, as Arnold Schoenberg once observed, really not a composer but &ldquo;an inventor of genius&rdquo; after all? Seen from the right perspective, the distinction can become extremely problematic. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t have any of these troubles because I just went into the sound,&rdquo; Dockstader remarks of such hesitancy. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care where it comes from or what you call it. I listened to it and heard the music in the sound.&rdquo;",
                "It was the FM stations, their existence fostered by a generation of amateur radio and hi-fi hobbyists, that provided a venue for Dockstader&rsquo;s tape compositions in the early 1960s. During this period, he would send out copies of his work to &ldquo;WQXR, WEIA, anyone who had a music programme that I thought might play it&rdquo;. Occasionally a Dockstader piece would be broadcast alongside work by Cage, Schaeffer or Kagel. &ldquo;I just sneaked them in,&rdquo; he recalls. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d send them around to stations, and every so often they&rsquo;d put me in a programme of New Music. Some of the people in these programmes were important people, and electronic music was a kind of curiosity, so I&rsquo;d get included.&rdquo;",
                "Acceptance was far from total, however. Dockstader&rsquo;s background as a studio engineer made him an unschooled &lsquo;primitive&rsquo;, so far as the music establishment was concerned. The frequent references to contemporary popular culture in his choice of titles also set him apart. <em>Luna Park</em>, for example, is the name of an old abandoned Coney Island attraction; <em>Travelling Music</em> is derived from a term Jackie Gleason used to describe musical filler on his TV show, while Dockstader&rsquo;s 1964 masterpiece <em>Quatermass</em> was titled after the British science fiction series. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d never seen the film,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;I found this book and thought that&rsquo;s a great title. I didn&rsquo;t see a Quatermass film until years afterwards. I wanted titles that sounded well, instead of <em>Study In This&hellip;</em>&rdquo;",
                "The flipside of uncertainty is openness: a willingness to accept and work with other possibilities, no matter where they might lead. &ldquo;No one had ever heard of me,&rdquo; Dockstader says of this highly creative period. &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know any other composers. I was totally outside. I was just some kind of plumber who came in and built sculpture out of pipes. In art, which I studied, that was acceptable - you know, urinals signed by R Mutt. But in music, &lsquo;What are you doing with this plumbing? What is this? Is that a faucet?&rsquo; Visual art was much more accepting.&rdquo;",
                "Despite the sense of isolation, Dockstader found interesting work being produced by other composers. He speaks warmly of Bebe and Louis Barron&rsquo;s electronic score for Ian Hugo&rsquo;s 1956 film <em>Jazz Of Lights</em> and Dick Raaijmakers&rsquo;s tape piece <em>Tweeklank</em>, created at the Philips Research Laboratories at Eindhoven in Holland. <em>Po&egrave;me &Eacute;lectronique</em>, created by Edgard Var&egrave;se at the same studio facilities in 1957, made the most enduring impression.",
                "&ldquo;The one piece that convinced me that what I was doing was worthwhile, that it was or could be important was <em>Po&egrave;me &Eacute;lectronique</em>,&rdquo; affirms Dockstader. &ldquo;Before that electronic music was all kind of raggedy and tentative stuff. There were jokes connected with it or it was performance-based. The piece stood up. Still does. It&rsquo;s got the simplicity and yet the size too.&rdquo;",
                "The inclusion of a piece by Dockstader in a broadcast featuring <em>Po&egrave;me &Eacute;lectronique</em> was enough for Var&egrave;se to contact him, suggesting that they work together at some later date. Unfortunately, the two never met, so nothing came of the proposal.",
                "A terse metallic roaring comes from beyond the trees as someone starts up a power tool. &ldquo;We have our own concert going on,&rdquo; Dockstader remarks calmly. &ldquo;A chainsaw sonata.&rdquo; His manner betrays the gracious, unfazed attitude of one who has nothing to prove any more. Whatever discouragement he received way back in the past remains way back in the past. The renewal of interest occasioned by the release of <em>Pond</em> and <em>Aerial</em> represents for him the chance of creating new work and having it published. That&rsquo;s still of great importance. &ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t just a question of doing it and playing it to a few friends,&rdquo; he says of his early albums. &ldquo;It was important to publish. I wanted it out there,&rdquo; he says. &ldquo;I wanted it to have a life, not just for a little circle of people sitting listening on the floor. I wanted it to go out and be tested, to stir things up a bit.&rdquo;",
                "Dockstader brought <em>Eight Electronic Pieces</em> out privately until Folkways made it part of their catalogue in 1961; later works were released under his supervision by Owl Records, a small label based in Colorado originally specialising in nature recordings. The craze for high-fidelity stereo created an expanding market for new sounds. &ldquo;I think hi-fi and stereo definitely made an audience for the kind of music I was making, because electronic music - at least the kind I made - needs space. I&rsquo;m not sure it would have survived or prospered without those two.&rdquo;",
                "In 1966, while working on <em>Omniphony</em>, a project commissioned by Owl, Dockstader caught a glimpse of the future. In order to blend the individual cells of his recorded sound with Reichert&rsquo;s orchestral sequences, the two transferred operations to Bob Moog&rsquo;s Electronic Music Centre in Trumansburg, New York. &ldquo;He was very interested in music,&rdquo; Dockstader recalls, &ldquo;but he was really messianic about his equipment. He was interested in musicians&rsquo; problems because that would tell him what was needed. He was a businessman and a promoter. I don&rsquo;t think he understood a lot of what we were doing.&rdquo;",
                "The advent of the switched on and well tempered keyboard led to magnetic tape undertaking an increasingly subservient role within the creation of electronic music. Unpredictable and unique, but laborious to uncover, the plastic mysteries of the recording head would soon become a thing of the past. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a curious thing,&rdquo; Dockstader remarks, contemplating how <em>Aerial</em> reaches back to his earliest memories of valve technology. &ldquo;The origin is very homely, the old shortwave analogue signal. I chose the subject because of my experience, because I remember the mysteries as a child. I started to see things because of these sounds and I was delighted that it was still there. It brought me back to a time when I was much younger.&rdquo;",
                "The initial collecting and mixing of the recorded signals were done on two-track analogue equipment. The piece began to take on its final shape and character only when Dockstader acquired a computer. &ldquo;The material had the potential for that scale,&rdquo; he points out. &ldquo;I could hear it in the original. You know, to anyone else it might just be noise, but I could build with it. I don&rsquo;t think anything from <em>Aerial</em> comes direct from the radio at all. It&rsquo;s all been treated and worked and made into something.&rdquo;",
                "What you finally get to hear in <em>Aerial</em>, however, is not the radio or the processes used to transform it, but rather the painstaking precision that Dockstader brings to its creation. &ldquo;I guess because of my background as an engineer I&rsquo;m so used to the tedium of detail,&rdquo; he explains. He has, after all, put in the time working with tape and a razor blade to &ldquo;get to the soul of the thing&rdquo;, as he puts it. &ldquo;I have to say that I&rsquo;m glad that I had to go through the analogue world when I was younger,&rdquo; concludes Dockstader. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do that kind of work today. For me it&rsquo;s lovely that the computer programs came along just at the time I needed them. You have no idea what a luxury it is to sit there quietly and make a calamity in my ears with just minimal movements.&rdquo;",

Most of my work has been 100% electronic, but I've always itched to work with some &quot;real world&quot; sounds, and this seemed to me ideal.

Living next to a small swamp, as I did, I heard them, and thought about it - but....",

I'd go out at night with a Nagra I had use of, and hunker down in bushes in people's yards, trying for tiny bug songs - but someone saw me hiding there and called the cops. I explained what I was doing to them and showed lots of ID and they told me to quit doing it and let me go.",

I'd re-wired a couple of cheap test-tone generators so that they produced a variety of variable bird-calls, peeper-peeps, and unidentified insect susurrations.

I made two exposures, flipped one over the other, as slides, and saw a kind of face emerge. And, after we'd gotten a ways into &quot;Pond,&quot; I remembered it - it seemed to go with the music.",
                "Part of what was fun for me was taking these real-life sounds that living animals make, and through various manipulations, winding up with tones that might have emerged from an electronic device. Some of what we hear is almost a straight nature recording, but in the next moment it becomes a symphony of oscillators...",
                "Yeah, that was unexpected - life imitating art.",
                "On your classic recordings from the 1960s, many of your sounds were derived from natural sounds like water drops, squeaking balloons, cats, trashcans, etc. Did you find that working on a computer with &quot;real&quot; sounds was vastly different? I'm sure it was faster than with tape, if nothing else...",
                "Yes, different, and much, much faster... that is, faster after I re-learned how to do it all. Once I did - and I'm still learning - I realised that many of the old principles - slowing, speeding, pitch-change, reversal, were the same - but with much more control and much better sound. And no tape hiss. And, in a way, because it was faster and I could keep my belief in what I was doing going, more fun. It's hard to believe - though I know it to be true - that such transcendant clarity of sound was achieved from such slimey and reluctant and monaural sources.",
                "Well, we certainly did a lot of maximizing and scrubbing of the source sounds, but also I think that probably we got a lot of clarity in the end because our transposing and transforming stages were pretty hi-fi. I know you like to work in 32 bits, for instance.",
                "I do that because the program I have told me to. But I do find that those extra bits help in clarifying complex, dense, sounds - which these became, with all the transformations. ...I noticed that &quot;Crepitata&quot; is the only cut with untreated ambience in it. And there isn't much of that. I think everything else was, like, transformed. I know I was. Even, as I recall, the &quot;bell&quot; melody in &quot;Springers&quot; was generated in response to amphibian sonorities. And I know the &quot;water drops&quot; in &quot;Glottalk&quot; were dopplered frogs, 'cause I dopped them. I went back into the files and enjoyed some of the names: &quot;Ghostly HooHoo, Held&quot; - as opposed to &quot;Let Go&quot;? - and &quot;Inept Frog Fiddles&quot;, &quot;Squirrly Ripple Down&quot;, &quot;Celtic Frog Lullaby&quot;, and the ever-popular &quot;God Knows, With Bells.&quot; There were 75 files of just &quot;Chuckles,&quot; for godsake - and I don't think any of them got into the Pond,",
                "You and I think a lot alike, but our working methods are sure different. When I was at your house I was impressed by your methodical notes about mixes and timings, etc. Not to mention the titling of every single trial and soundfile. I'm way messier -  I throw stuff in a pile, grab some later while doing a composition and just see what fits. When the mix is done, I have little idea what the sources were. Not very scientific, Im afraid. But hell, whatever works...",
                "I agree on &quot;Whatever works.&quot; As to the rest: I am anal-retentive - with everything, and always have been. And, since I'm always doing things over and over, I have to be able to find the parts. Else, chaos reigns, and I'm not fond of that. ...Did you ever mention to (Pond publisher) Chris Cutler that you'd done surround mixes?",
                "Yes, I did. I was really enthused about doing Pond as a surround Audio-DVD release, but the more I worked on that, the more apparent what a total pain it was going to be, especially because we don't have a single common piece of software between us. We're a queasy marriage of Mac and PC, and it's lucky we could pull this off at all. Also, I was afraid that the mastering for disc was going to be a major roadblock, and the cost for a small label might not be doable. But I'm quite pleased with our stereo version.",
                "I am, too. In fact, I now suspect - having explored surround, myself - that it would have been too much. All the side-sounds would have detracted from the main left-right ideas, and it all could have easily become a blur. Might have been fun, but the details would likely have been lost and the listener - drowned. And I don't want to drown any listeners - there are so few of them, as it is. Also, there's a whole lot of aural movement going on - and that don't hardly exist in nature: these critters, generally, just sit there, all night. But in our pond, they're wheeling around and to-and-fro-ing all over the place. It's what nature would have done if she'd thought of it, careless broad...",
                "Um, I guess it's up to we artistes to improve upon nature, huh?",
                "Well, it could use some improvement, and who else's going to do it?",
                "Really though, movement is one of the tools in the box, and we needed all possible weapons to nudge these guys into something more than a static &quot;ribbitt&quot;. And, once you change somebody's gender, bend them in half, and age them 500%, flinging them across the room seems a small insult...",
                "It was a gift. Think of how bored they must have been, sitting on that same lillypad, night after night. Now, they'll be frequent flyers... In general, I can now understand all that detailed work we put in on each voice: cleaning and cleaning and etc., so it would shine. All the hundreds of &quot;noises&quot; we excluded, click by smutch by rustle by thump. The damn thing really... glitters, now - so much so that I don't think it will matter where in hell we dug up the band members. It won't matter.",
                "No, it doesn't. Sound is sound, and we could've used car door slams instead.",

                "I met Jim Reichert around 1962 at the Gotham Recording studios in NYC, where I'd been working as an engineer since about 1959. He was working for CBS television as a music supervisor picking out recorded cue music for their live drama shows. He was interested in what I'd been doing with tape - I'd done the Eight Pieces, Luna Park and Drone by then, and was working on Water Music. I had a lot of other sounds in the bank, which he listened to and suggested we collaborate on something. He took the tapes home and started writing, orchestrating and expanding on the ideas.",
                "This was not for any particular purpose?",
                "At this stage, no, but of course if it actually came to doing something there would be musicians and studio time to pay, which would cost money that neither of us had. But Jim knew his way around and drafted a proposal. He approached some foundations and even tried a subscription plan, neither of which elicited any interest. Eventually, it turned out he already knew someone who knew someone who had a record company. That was Owl Records - and they were looking for something new. I'd completed Water Music and Quatermass by then, and I'd been trying in vain to find a home for them. Owl bought the Concerto Grosso idea (Jim's original project title), but they knew it would take some time. Meanwhile they were still looking for material for immediate release. I sent them my three LPs worth, which they put out, piecemeal, while they waited for the 'Concerto' to be completed.",
                "And how was that done?",
                "It took time until we were finally ready to record the instruments. Then the studio session turned out... rough ...a hard day's nightmare. We got through it eventually. The players worked hard and didn't complain, even though some of their parts were almost unplayable. For the transformation of the instrumental tapes we went to Bob Moog's studio in Trumansburg. We ran the instrumental tapes through his filters and ring modulators and the rest, trying to make them blend with the sound of my original &quot;cell&quot; tapes. It took two days. So now we had my original tapes, the studio instrumental tapes and the &quot;Mooged&quot; tapes. Jim pretty much took over at this stage. He'd become a good editor, but as an engineer, he had a way to go: he kept mixing down into overloads, and you can hear some of that still on the CD (as bass IM distortion). But that's my problem. Owl liked it and named it; and that's when it became Omniphony.",
                "The two additional pieces that make up this CD you said were respectively the oldest and the newest pieces of yours in print?",
                "Yes, No. 7 was the seventh of my first &quot;Eight Pieces&quot; and the first I composed in parts. It was more planned than the first six, which were largely improvised on the fly and then cut-and-recut into shape. I can hear in it pots and pans, oil wells, doors, laughter, water, and some things I have no idea what they were. So I guess it was the first piece in which my &quot;style&quot;, if I can be said to have one, appeared. &quot;Past Prelude&quot; was going to be the first part of &quot;The Aerial Etudes&quot; which I'd started in the 90s. I'd taken it out of the &quot;Etudes,&quot; but I still liked it for itself. Apparently, I did four mixes of it and, as often happens, the first was the best."

Why I started was because I really wanted to make a kind of music, and I was worried about being an unlettered primitive and so I shouldn't call it any kind of &quot;music,&quot; what I was doing. I wanted to make music out of sound, instead of sound out of music - which is what people who write Music intend to do. And, with tape, for the first time, I could do that. Of course, most of the world's people make music without writing it out first; they always have.",

                "No. I hadn't gone to their school, a Music school. I'd gone to my own school: I learned cooking in the kitchen. I apprenticed as a sound engineer in a big New York studio, in the 'Fifties. I went pretty fast through that school because I'd already done film editing in Hollywood, and a film editor in a little studio has to cut a lot of sound. It was all optical sound in those days, but the principals were the same.",
                "What kind of films were they?",
                "Animated cartoons. The studio was UPA, a little place across the street from the big Warner lot. I got the apprentice editing job because I could draw; I guess they needed an editor who could understand the artists. The studio's gone now, and the New York sound studio; so much is gone. I always felt comfortable in studios, at home right away.",
                "Were you ever involved on the other side of the camera, with the visual side of film?",
                "I did a few original storyboards, on my own time, that were made into films. One was about an ice-cream salesman, drove a Good Humor type of truck around and got so he couldn't stand that same lame tune looping all day. So, he installed a pipe-organ in his truck instead of the jingle-machine. I wanted the organ to play the Bach <em>Toccata and Fugue in d</em>, but the staff composer said, no way, he wanted the credit. So he wrote a tune which wasn't much better than the first one. That was my first exposure to the business of music: they wouldn't let me play what I wanted.",
                "What models did you have when you did begin to play what you wanted?",
                "I'd heard some early work in Hollywood, done by film-makers working with optical tracks, drawing on them. There were the Whitney brothers and a Canadian, Norman McLaren, working in the 'Forties and early 'Fifties. They drew these little soundtracks for their films, before tape. They sounded quite &quot;electronic,&quot; whatever that was. And l'd seen and heard a film by the Barrons, <em>Jazz of Lights</em>, which <em>was</em> electronic, this was mid-'Fifties. It was all new to me, and at the same time it sounded somehow familiar: I knew how they did it. So, as soon as I got the chance, in New York, I started in.",
                "Had you heard any musique concr&#232;te?",
                "I think I must have, at least on the radio in New York. Probably Schaeffer's '48 <em> Etudes</em> - the train thing and the saucepan thing - and the first Luening and Ussachevsky tapes of the 'Fifties. I still have the first LP of musique concr&#232;te; I think that was '60 or '61. But I'd already done my first <em>Eight Pieces</em> by then. 1 don't think I modeled my first work after anyone in particular, not consciously anyway. I just knew how to do it. In working on a Moviola, you could run tracks backward and speed them up and slow them down, and edit sounds. Before tape came in, and that's about all they wore doing, technically. What was important to me was they were doing this as music, what Schaeffer called &quot;a new art of sound.&quot; That idea was my model.",
                "He followed that statement with, &quot;Am I wrong in still calling it music?&quot;",
                "Yes. As I said, I worried about that, too.",
                "And now Schaeffer has decided that he was wrong, after all-",
                "No. It's music. Maybe not DoRoeMi -maybe ImErOd -but still music. I was sorry to learn he finally decided he was 'wrong.' But he was carrying around that burden of thinking of music with a big M again, and that can wear you down. That, and his friend, Boulez, hitting on him, in print, that &quot;wide-eyed dilettante&quot; and &quot;miserable amateur&quot; business.",
                "How were you treated by &quot;official&quot; musicians?",
                "- Better than that; they ignored me. I was, after all, an &quot;amateur,&quot; maybe not wide-eyed or miserable, but - if they'd heard of me at all - just an engineer, not to be taken at all seriously. But that was OK. The only time it affected me was when I was running out of facilities, studio time, and I applied to the Columbia-Princeton Center, and got refusal letters from both Luening and Ussachevsky. I should have known: the establishment had the guns, they weren't about to lend any to some shoeless Zapatista. By &quot;shoe-less,&quot; I mean I hadn't the credentials they would recognize.",
                "Which is why your work isn't included in most of the official histories and lexicons of music?",
                "I suppose. I'm mentioned in a few. I was surprised to find myself in them, a self-taught old concrete-mixer like me.",
                "What was so attractive to you about concrete source material?",
                "I liked acoustic sound, air-moving sounds. I like the way they breathe and occupy the space around them. Particularly when I slowed them down, all those fine partials were revealed, changing in time, with the room-tone in them, the music in them. Just changing the pitch of a sound doesn't reveal its secrets, at least not for me. For me, acoustic sound, working in it, there s a built-in something, emotion, in it. lt talks to me. And, practically, I had no synthesizer of any kind; practically no one did, back then.",
                "But you did manage to use electronic sounds in your early work.",
                "I had one or two audio test-generators. The studio used them to calibrate everything. I used them for another voice, to compliment my concrete voices. Also, they were scale-less, untempered: you played them by tuning a big dial. At times, they were distempered, the way I used them-because they only did sine waves, pure tones, and I distorted them into all kinds of useful, raggedy waves and pulses, so they'd meld with the timbres of my concrete sounds. I had no prejudice for or against electronic sound, still don't. All that &quot;purity&quot; business in the 'Fifties and 'Sixties: &quot;Don't bring that cat into our concert hall!&quot; It made me tired. I used whatever I could get my hands on, even if only for an hour. And, because I worked in this commercial studio, I got my hands on some nifty sound-makers, like orchestral chimes, timpani, vibes - whatever was left behind after a session.",
                "You played these instruments yourself?",
                "If you can call it that, yes. Sometimes, I played the chimes by blowing into them; the timpani, by spinning a half-dollar on its head. At the same time, I was recording my performances, and it was some kind of workout, running back and forth between the control room and this airdrome sized studio, trying to et it on tape. Because, I had to do this alone, when the studio was empty, usually at night after engineering a session. These were all rented instruments, musical instruments, an engineer didn't touch them. But, to me, they were simply sound sources, like un-oiled doors and amorous cats.",
                "You had no studio of your own all this time, no equipment?",
                "I had a little hi-fi monaural tape recorder at home, and one of the first tube condenser microphones; it had a &quot;Telefunken&quot; label on it. The studio was going to throw it away because no one liked the sound of it, so it came to me. It heard a lot of the sounds that went into my music. I still have it. The only real instrument at home was my wife's piano; Beverly plays the piano very well. I played it with two tape-head demagnitizers on the strings. She was incredibly patient with all this. I left her piano all out of tune, but, by God, it had no residual magnetism left in it.",
                "Then, how did you decide how to use these sounds? How did you structure a piece?",
                "At first, I had a bad time with that. I had to learn it by making all kinds of messes. Those first few little pieces, they seemed to take forever. I'd set up my sounds on a couple of machines - they were monaural, then - and mix to a third, and take that mix and mix it with more sounds, on and on, and I was having a fine time. And I'd come in the next day and listen to it: nothing. It was so thick you couldn't hear anything. So, I stopped mixing and just sat and listened to my unmixed sounds again, until I understood what they wanted to say. I learned to respect my orchestra. Somehow, over period of a month or more. we got together, my sounds and I, and the pieces started to emerge out of all that tape, I emerged them with a single-edged razor blade. I think I used more blades than Sweeney Todd; I cut mountains of tape out of those mixes. Like the old description of sculpting: to make a bust of Socrates, you get a big block of stone, and cut away everything that doesn't look like Socrates. In time, the mountains turned into molehills because I became surer of my mixes, going in.",
                "So, you had no example to follow in composing?",
                "I had all the music I'd ever heard, and, when it came time for me to make some, I had my own feeling about it, which was the Yo-Yo theory of composition: you slowly let it out, and then you quickly pull it back in. More pedantically, you build tension over time, then release. The trick is in the timing and not breaking the string. I broke a lot of strings. But it was working.Then, sometime around my seventh piece, I heard Var&#232;se's Poeme Electronique for the first time. I heard the economy and the richness of it, the risk and control - in eight minutes, so much. After that, when I did my eighth piece, I went very carefully, patiently. I even mixed at 15 ips for the first time. Everything had been at seven-and-a-half before that, to save on tape. Sounds silly now, I know, but to me it meant a big commitment: this was for keeps, now, because now I knew music could be made out of sound.",
                "Did you ever meet Var&#232;se, at that time or later?",
                "No. He called me up on the 'phone once, after WXQR had played the <em>Poeme</em> and followed it with my Eighth Piece, which I'd sent them on a tape. He said something about how nice it was to have our work played, and it was: for me, it was the first time, my first performance. He asked me if I'd do some engineering for him - they'd said on the programme that I was an engineer. I think he'd said we'd &quot;collaborate&quot; on something he was working on.",
                "But you didn't.",
                "No. I never heard from him again. I think he was re-doing the tape for <em>Deserts</em> for the L.P., but he got all the help he needed at the Columbia-Princeton Center. A lot of doors opened to him in those last years.",
                "Did his influence stay with you, in your work?",
                "In a way. Not so much in structure; he had his own, and I was already moving in my own direction in that. It was his - seriousness, his attitude toward tape music. It was worth the work, it wasn't a joke or a momentary blip in the history of music, as most people thought at that time. That attitude sustained me in my own work.",
                "You said that broadcast with Var&#232;se was your first &quot;performance.&quot;",
                "I thought of it that way, because growing up in the 'Thirties and 'Forties, radio had been my concert hall. There was a lot of serious music on then; all the big orchestras were broadcasting live, every week. And now, it was the only hall my own music might be played in: where else? So, I sent out these dubs to the stations.",
                "What was the reaction?",
                "Well, they played it. And I know three people heard it: myself, Var&#232;se, and the station engineer. I know the engineer heard it because he played along with it, on the air.",
                "He what?",
                "He treated it as an add-a-part composition, contributing a few tones with his test generator during the broadcast, some boops and beeps of his own. I thought I was going crazy: Wait a minute, that's not in the piece! But, it was typical of the reaction at that time: this isn't Music, it's a joke, let's have some fun with it. And it wasn't just my piece, he played over the Poeme, too.",
                "Did this happen often to you?",
                "Only that first time, that I heard. They'd do other things, playing only half of my tape - the top half of a two-track stereo tape. The FM stations were all monaural, then, but they were talking about going multiplex stereo, so I sent them stereo tapes. And they'd run them through their compressors and turn them into total distortion, total fuzz. I don't know, maybe they resented me as an upstart engineer; the announcer would always say I was, before the piece was played. A station engineer had to respect music by a musician.",
                "But you kept sending them tapes-",
                "Yes, There was a lot of activity on FM, then, programmes that would play new music, all kinds. My work got into some fast company: Cage and Stockhausen and Babbitt and all. They even programmed my Water Music with Telemann's and Handel's, I think that was someone's idea of a musical joke, or trying to provoke a riot, but I was pIeased. And, after a time, they asked me to do some interviews on the radio, and I struggled through them. Those were the only ones I've done, before this. This was all early 'Sixties.",
                "I think you are being too modest! But you had no records out?",
                "I had one - well, two, if you count the one I made, myself. I knew how to master LP lacquers, so I did my first Eight Pieces, monaural, and made a hundred pressings, this was'61. I sold them door to door, among record stores in New York, and sent them around to the record companies as a sort of <em>fait accompli</em> demo, and Folkways fell for it and remastered and released it as Eight Electronic Pieces. So l thought I was really in business, now; I'd have no more trouble getting my work published. I should have realised: Folkways was a wildly eclectic label. My work was in there with LPs of African thumb pianos, gamelan music and whirling dervish chanting and what-all - all of which sold better than mine. At least,they didn't want any more from me. Nor did anyone else, for five years.",
                "Those were the years in which you did most of the work that we have now?",
                "Yes. It piled up on me, like - a load. I felt like a peddler, lugging this big sack of things around with me, things no one seemed to want. I got some of it on the radio, but that was transitory: when the programme ended, it was gone - unless someone taped it off the air. I needed publication that would give the music a chance to last for a while. I kept sending tapes and acetates to all the record companies - and those stereo acetates were hard to cut, very time-consuming. Some of the companies never returned them and some of the tapes came back unplayed, I could tell. Even some of the FM stations started to back off, not just from my work but from any new music - the start of the present ice-age of FM, I guess. I got a call from a programme director at QXR that they weren't going to play any music later than Hindemith,so please stop sending them tapes. And then, finally, Owl showed up and lifted the load from me.",
                "You'd sent them tapes?",
                "No. I didn't know about them. The offer came through a friend of a friend. So, I supervised the lacquer mastering in New York from my original master tapes. It took quite a while, what with test pressings to and fro - Owl was out in Colorado - and designing album covers, writing the notes and all. It was a great time for me, even though I didn't get any music done, any new music. But getting the records done, done well, for me was part of making the music.",
                "Did they get any attention?",
                "There were a few reviews, very few. They ranged from bewildered to careful. The careful ones kind of liked it, with the suggestion that they shouldn't. Because it didn't fit: new music, then, was supposed to be either aleatoric or atonal, and what I'd done wasn't either one. It was even &quot;tonal,&quot; in its own way, and rhythmic at times, which wasn't being done. So, they didn't know how to pick up my work, or even if they should - it didn't have a handle they could recognize. Later, in the early 'Eighties, the records got some informed reviews. But I didn't know about them until much later; they came too late to change things for me.",
                "You'd stopped composing before that?",
                "Yes.",
                "Why?",
                "Well - that's hard for me to answer. It wasn't the watery reviews or anything like that. I think - in a way, I just got bone-tired. I'd done quite a lot of music in a relatively short time. I'd almost lived in that studio for six, seven years, engineering by day and doing my music in down-time, nights, and weekends there. Concrete and electronic music was an expensive music to make, then; it cost a lot in time and money - too much money, in those days, for some one working alone. And time: not just composing time, but maintenance and repair. l was pushing those studio machines hard, and they were always breaking down and I had to stop and fix them right then, no waiting, so they'd be ready the next working day. A regular composer, what's the worst will happen? He breaks a pencil, he loses a few seconds. l break a big Ampex and you lose most of a day, or, in my case, your job if you can't get it working again. And the heat: those machines were all tubes, everything was tubes, then. The decks would get so hot you couldn't touch them and you'd have to turn them off to cool down for a while. It really was like a kitchen. I read, much later, where someone from those days - maybe Berio - said he couldn't believe he put in all that physical work that tape-music demanded. Of course, he had another way to make music: he went back to writing, as Stockhausen and most others did around that time, late 'Sixties, 'Seventies. I suspect many of them turned away with a sigh of relief. But, as I've said, I wanted to make music out of sound, not the other way around, even if I could have. And then, things were changing even while I was still at it. The &quot;Glorious Junkshop,&quot; as someone called it, of concrete was closing. And it did.",
                "The synthesizer arrived.",
                "It was arriving. In '64, I got a letter from someone named Robert A. Moog, inviting me to look at his new &quot;instruments for electronics music composition&quot; - his words - at the AES convention in New York. How he got my name, I don't know; this was before my LPs came out. So, I went, I looked, I saw a keyboard and a prototype wall of knobs and wires. I listened, and I got a sinking feeling that my kind of music was ending here. My peculiar skills were going to be obsolete, like a blacksmith looking at his first automobile. That keyboard: that meant the writers were going to take over electronic music. And so, we got Switched-On this-and-that and Dancing Snowflakes and all, in just a few years.",
                "Did you ever work with a synthesizer?",
                "Once, when I was working on a - I guess you'd call it a commissioned piece for Owl, in'66.",
                "That was Omniphony?",
                "That's what it turned out as, yes. A composer I knew wanted to turn some of my noise into Music, with an orchestra and all; Owl paid for the orchestra. Then we took those tapes up to Bob Moogs studio, upstate New York, and ran them through his Mighty Moog, trying to, as it turned out, produce something that was neither here nor there. That whole experience was one of the things that helped blow out any flaming desire to continue to make music at that time; it was really bad.",
                "How 'bad'?",
                "Oh boy... well, I'll give you just one of the things that happened; it seems my co-composer liked to go into the studio, Gotham, late at night and play this work-in-progress for his, I guess, musical friends. And, one night, one of them went mad during the playback and smashed up the studio, put his arm through a glass-panelled door, and sprayed blood all over the place - and I had to go in and try to clean it all up before the studio opened in the morning. There were other extra-musical events like that. Anyway, I left the studio and I left him to finish the piece, which he did, and the LP came out and everybody was happy. But I was gone. There's one little part of the piece I like: the rest I can't listen to anymore.",
                "So then you had no studio to work in?",
                "Right. I tried to go on for a while, cobbling together some equipment at home, working nights. I got a suitcase organ, a Gibson 'combo' organ, the same model Ray Manzarek played on the road, and I rewired it into an affordable synthesizer, or something. This was before suitcase synthesizers appeared, like the MiniMoog and the Arps. The keyboard I'd made so odd, distempered and unstable, that I felt at home with it. But what I was doing wasn't like anything I'd done, and almost no one liked it, the few that heard it. One, a musician I knew, said, 'What are you doing playing chords? What is this counterpoint? You're not supposed to do that.' Maybe he was right: the record companies I tried, a bit half-heartedly by then, had no interest in it.",
                "Owl Records didn't take it?",
                "Owl had gone out of business by then, or evaporated or otherwise ceased to be; I never knew just what happened. They came back later, changed. Folkways went; the tiny royalties stopped; all my bridges burned. Later, I destroyed most of what I'd tried to do. I kept a piece of it, called it <em>Animated Khartoum,</em> which was a bad pun on my UPA days, and also because my rewired organ tended to produce Arabic sounds. lt had a nasal condition. That was the last &quot;serious&quot; piece I did.",
                "That was what, 1970?",
                "About then. I'd left New York to work on sound and visual design for some big expositions, in Canada and the U.S. I shot film, stills, did a lot of soundtracks for that. Then, I got into making videos and film-strips (another obsolete form of communication, now) for educational publishers, writing and researching. I wrote and directed a lot of video programs on American history. I liked that, the subject. You may have noticed I have an affinity for the past.",
                "And music?",
                "I did some, for the various things I wrote. Most of the music I used was Period - obviously, with history - and I couldn't improve on that. I'd compose something to solve a narrative problem. For instance, I used my old concrete skills to underscore the battle of Verdun, working from the soldiers' descriptions of how it sounded - the huge roaring and sighing. I'd write opportunities for my music into my scripts. I was using about everything I'd ever learned to do, in that work. It was good work for me; it was generally a good time for me. I was busy, the years went by fast. But then, the publishers started going for computer programs - here we go again - and I just wasn't Interactive enough for that. That was committee-work, and I'd always worked alone. And, just then, I got a couple of offers to do CDs of all my old work - the music.",
                "How did you feel about that?",
                "Astounded. I hadn't listened to it myself, for a long time. I didn't know if the old master tapes would play, so I wouldn't agree to it until I'd hauled them out and listened to them.",
                "How was it?",
                "Painful, at first. There was some deterioration of the tapes, drying out, and all those hundred of splices peeling apart. When I played them, little piles of iron oxide would appear beneath the heads and tape-guides, and I thought, there goes the music - rust to dust. So, the next time I ran them, I made careful analog dubs, the best I could do, on professional equipment, to new tape. Some parts were really bad, but I managed to get dubs from an old friend that hadn't deteriorated (the tape, not the friend) and replaced those sections; there were only a few. So then I said, OK we'll do the CDs from my new dub-masters.",
                "How did you feel about the music, after so long?",
                "At first, I hardly heard it as music; all I worried about was the sound. How's this going to stand up to CD sound-quality? I told the producer, Tom Steenland, we'd have to release them as Historic Recordings, like Edison cylinders. But, after the CDs came out, a hi-fi magazine asked for copies to use as test records for rating new equipment - so, either l'd underestimated my tapes or overestimated the State of the Art. After I'd settled down, I started to hear the music again, and again and again, with all the DAT transfers to approve and the CD references. It was very strange: it was almost like listening to someone else's work. But I liked it. I began to hear what I'd wanted to do in it: it stood up, for me. And, after a while, for others. The first reviews were: Uh, what is this stuff? Where did this come from? One reviewer called it &quot;free - form jazz,&quot; whatever that is. But, just now the reviews have been better by far than anything the music ever got in it's day. when it was made.",
                "That's probably not very surprising - I think Var&#232;se once remarked that the Composer was never ahead of his time, the public were behind it. Also - you have a new generation now, who grew up listening that way; for them it's not so strange.",
                "Still, I was stunned; I never thought it would happen. Most of these reviewers, and people I heard from were, as you say, young - young to me, anyway - most with a whole different background in time and music from my own.",
                "Do you think there's a reason for that? - do you think your work is somehow close to the sensibilities of people with a group, or rock, background?",
                "I wasn't aware of that. I remember I got a couple of 'phone calls in the 'Eighties from someone, I don't remember his name, who said he was working in a group, composing, or trying to, and they were all listening to my LPs, and could I tell him what to do. I didn't know what to say to him, except, don't worry it, just do it. Because, I'd always worked alone, not even listening to other people's music then, let alone working in a group. So, what were they hearing in my music? I don't know; maybe - it's the hands.",
                "&quot;Hands&quot;?",
                "Well - in painting, which I studied, seriously, in school, we used to say a painter we liked had &quot;good hands.&quot; You could see his hand in the work, in the brush-work. This was early 'Fifties, with painters like DeKooning and Bacon; they had great hands. And, for me, like painting, making music was always a very physical thing, very tactile. I played those tape machines like a DJ plays turntables, rocking reels back and forth, pulling the tape through by hand. The only time I sat down was to edit - more hand-work - otherwise I was always in motion. Maybe, because rock is a hand-made music - isn't it? -they heard that in my work. I really don't know.",
                "You mentioned Manzarek. Did you ever listen to rock?",
                "Yes, in the late 'Sixties, when they were starting to explore, the groups were trying new things. I even wrote an article about it, I guess it was the first one about &quot;electronic rock.&quot; It was published in the old <em>Electronic Music Review</em>. I don't know if their readership knew what I was talking about, then. So, I heard a lot, saw some of the groups - the Doors, the Who, the Holding Company, a lot of others long gone now. But before then, when I was doing the music, no. When I was working, I didn't listen to any other music.",
                "Why not?",
                "There wasn't time to listen to anything other than what I was doing. And, it was a self-protective thing, too. I had to protect my innocence - what the critics called my ignorance; I had to keep my ears clean. After I came out of the studio, finally, I started listening again. There was a lot of new music to listen to then. I even reviewed some of it.",
                "In revenge?",
                "No, not at all. I really wanted to <em>like</em> everything. But I found out it was hard to write a 'good' review, much easier to write a bad one. Something about the English language: all the really colourful adjectives are bad, disapproving. And they were sending me these awful records, electro-pop and cosmic-nothing music. It got so I had to tell the editor - this was <em>The Musical Quarterly</em> - I couldn't do it anymore. People say reviews don't mean anything, record reviews, but these records <em>were</em> the music, itself - not just another performance of it - so these were the only reviews the music was going to get. I think to go on doing that, a reviewer has to be someone who's never been reviewed.",
                "How about now? What do you like of contemporary music?",
                "No. No more reviewing.",
                "Alright, no names. Just generally.",
                "I haven't heard much new music, but, alright: most of what I've heard, instrumental and electronic, sound Neo-something to me: looking backward. Drone, and minimal, and New-Age-therapeutic - they were starting to do that back when I was reviewing, and I had trouble with it then. I didn't think it all would become so important. The minimal music I've heard recalls, for me, Schaeffer's locked groove Etudes - more ornate, but still... It conjures up images from Fritz Lang's film, <em>Metropolis</em>: all these people being sequenced like automatons, endlessly labouring away. Very sad, a mis-use of human beings. Some of it's pretty. But, no.",
                "What other non acoustic musics have you heard? Any computer music?",
                "I'm not just sure what that is. I heard a little, when I was writing my notes for the CD booklets. Someone had come up with the phrase 'Computer Concrete' and I wanted to find out what that was. I asked a computer composer and he said there was no such thing. So, later, he came out with a CD of his computer-concrete music, so named. Hm. The little I've heard, I have trouble with. Digital sampling, unless it's very fast, staccato, sounds dead to me, truncated. Because, I feel real-world sounds, as they call them now, have to exist in time: they have a lifetime that has to be respected. If you slice them into a single-cycle loop, you'll lose that lovely timbral change over time, you lose most of the life in the sound. And then, you pitch-change this snippet down a keyboard? So you can have a chainsaw doing Ave Maria? This is the liberation of sound?",
                "Hugh Le Caine did 'Happy Birthday To You' using only the scream at the end of Berg's Zulu: but admittedly, that was meant to be a joke.",
                "Yes, forgive the outburst. I think it's because I expected too much. After all this time, I thought they'd have come much farther with the Liberation. They say it'll be better, all they need is more memory. I think I have too much: I remember the promise. So, all this seems a little sad to me, a failure of nerve, somehow. I probably just haven't heard the good work; all I have are store records. Very likely, the good stuff is piling up in someone's closet.",
                "Do you ever think about starting again?",
                "Very good, a change of subject, thank you. You mean, start piling up my own closet again? Yes. Just now, I'm starting to work on a new piece - starting all over, I should say. Years ago, I had to dump all my original materials, the miles and miles of tape that went into the music I did, my &quot;samples.&quot; There wasn't anyplace to store it all, and what was I going to do with it, anyway? So, I'm beginning to collect some new sounds again, toward an idea I have. God knows how long it will take; I'm using mostly old equipment, salvaged analogue.",
                "Could you describe the piece?",
                "No. There's no piece yet, only pieces. And I wouldn't, if I could. The work, itself, is enough for me now, more than I thought I would have again. Work for my hands and ears, grand, tedious work. So, finally, I feel lucky: to have lived long enough to see the music come back - to have avoided being in the old joke, where the composer walks into the publisher's office with his music and is told, &quot;Come back when you've been dead a hundred years.&quot; I didn't have to wait that long - although music, making it, involves a lot of waiting: you do what you can, when you can, and then you have to be able to wait for things to come to you, ideas, whatever will. Sometimes, wait without hope. I believe I started doing what I did around the time Schaeffer stopped. When he began, he called it &quot;musique,&quot; and then decided it wasn't. When I began, I didn't call it music, and now I do. So, I think, after all, I've maybe had a better time."

Once sounds have been abstracted from events, they are free to act and interact as signs; they are no longer indications of the real. And from their use as indicators we learn new meanings (the low drone from Jaws, the shower strings from Psycho, a TV theme, these are all as directly meaningful to us as a barking dog or an approaching train; after 1000 movies, the sound of a helicopter has as many fictional as factual meanings, and these accretions make experience imaginatively richer). This is the language Dockstader and Myers explore, and although, in a sense, such signs are weightless (there is nothing there), nevertheless we cannot unhook them and inevitably they conjure fragmentary narratives, events, places, situations and meanings. Where their last CD (Pond) abstracted sound from the life (in fact, documentary recordings of frogs), this one invokes a fictional life invoked in a language of purely mediated abstraction.",

David Lee Myers released a number of recordings in the 1980s under the name <em>Arcane Device</em>, where the musical material was derived from almost uncontrollable feedback systems. In this recording, Dockstader used computers to manipulate the sounds for the first time, with the assistance of Myers, and recently remarked that he 'realised that many of the old principles - slowing, speeding, pitch-change, reversal - were the same - but with much more control and better sound (and no tape hiss).

                "Dockstader became a self-taught sound engineer and sound effects specialist and apprenticed as a recording engineer in 1958. It was around this time that he started to use his off-work hours at Gotham Recording Studios to experiment with musique concr&#232;te. By 1960 he had amassed enough material to assemble his first composition Eight Pieces (later to be used in the soundtrack of Fellini's Satyricon), the last of which was re-worked into his first stereo piece Travelling Music. His last piece at Gotham was Four Telemetry Tapes in 1965, after which he left to work as an audio-visual designer on the Air Canada Pavillion at Montreal's Expo '67. It was around this time that some of Dockstader's pieces were released on three Owl L.P.s, and his work became known to a larger audience (he had previously released some pieces on Folkways). However, he no longer had access to studio facilities and was denied access to the major electronic music centres because of his lack of academic credentials. He therefore concentrated on educational audio-visual productions, and has written and produced hundreds of filmstrips and videos for schools."

                "I don't remember just when I first heard <em>musique concr&#232;te</em>; it must have been in the early 50s. I think I liked the <em>idea</em> of it more than the Toonerville-Trolley sound of the early pieces. In Pierre Schaeffer's original definition, it meant working with the sound in your ears, directly with the sound, as opposed to &quot;abstract&quot; music in which the sounds are written. Like Schaeffer, a working sound engineer, I had the training to be a &quot;worker in rhythms, frequencies and intensities.&quot; As a non-musician, I couldn't write music, but this &quot;new art of sound&quot; didn't need notation. In the beginning, <em>musique concr&#232;te</em> wasn't even agreed upon to be music; Schaeffer's first presentation of his work was called &quot;a concert of noises.&quot;",
                "It also seemed to me, this new art of sound, a very democratic art. I'd studied painting for five years and gave it up, primarily because I came to dislike the exclusivity of it; a painting became the property of one person, one institution. I liked the idea that Schaeffer's first work was created in a (public) radio studio; his first premieres were <em>broad</em>casts, not the &quot;narrowcasts&quot; of concert hall performances. And, when you bought a recording of it, you owned the work just as much as anyone else, because the work was a recording. So, I pursued that.",
                "Any art is, of course, not just all the possibilities; it is also choice - organization. That this new sound-art could be rigorously organized I first learned by hearing Edgar Var&#232;se's Poeme Electronique of 1958 - a powerfully dramatic work in which the strength and personality of choice among all the possibilities is very evident. My choice of the term &quot;Organized Sound&quot; for my own work was, in part, a tribute to the <em>Po&egrave;me</em> and Var&#232;se.",
                "I also chose it because, in the '60s, the term &quot;electronic music&quot; was coming to mean music made purely of synthetic sound, and I was working in <em>both</em> &quot;concrete&quot; and electronically generated sounds."

From the start, I had preferred 20<sup>th</sup> century music, or at least what there was of it that was dramatic, colorful, and adventurous - everything from Stravinsky's <em>Firebird</em> to Messiaen's <em> Turangulila Symphony</em> to Boulez's <em>Le Marteau sans maitre</em> (three that pop into mind). Of all I heard, the three electronic pieces I can hum are Var&#232;se's <em>Poeme</em>, Stockhausen's <em>Gesang der Junglinge</em>.",
                "As I went, the sound got easier but the organization got harder, and I entered into a struggle I hadn't anticipated. John Cage (in <em>Silence</em>) tells of the effort it took him to overcome his musical training and become a Listener to sound again. There came a struggle to resist forcing the sounds too far into Music and away from a true art of sound, This, I think, is the continuing struggle in electronic music of all kinds. It's very hard to stay a Listener. I think I was aided, in my time and circumstances, by not having a synthesizer of any kind: no keyboards, no pre-set voices.",
                "My &quot;synthesizer&quot; for everything on this CD was one or two sine-wave test generators (&quot;oscillators&quot; in those days) which were &quot;played&quot; by turning a dial. I forced them to produce harmonics (square waves) by amplifying them into distortion, and got the pulse-trains out of them by temporarily rewiring them into instability (temporarily, because they had to resume life the next day as stable test generators). The &quot;notes&quot; they produced were achieved by editing tape, not by note (by note by note...). For <em>Quatermass</em>, I acquired a Heathkit test generator of my own, which I built to allow me to &quot;switch&quot; tones instead of having to &quot;tune&quot; them (like a radio). Also, when turned on or off, it made marvellous shrieks and groans.",
                "Some composers who worked in what's been called the &quot;glorious junkshop&quot; of the now-classic tape studios have looked back in awe and dismay at the amount of hard, physical work it took to make a piece. But easier isn't necessarily better. I enjoyed it: I found it was like the best part of painting - standing on your feet all day, moving around, working with your hands , sometimes very fast, more often very slowly, mixing, cutting, stitching it together with the sound in your ears. It had a muscular joy to it. I think a lot of us had fun up on that singin high wire, teetering between control and chaos, trying to push the sound a little farther forward toward Something we hadn't heard before, working <em>in</em> it...

                    "Tod Dockstader was born in 1932 at St. Paul, Minnesota, USA. He went on to become a graduate art student, working in painting, film, and also as a cartoonist for newspapers and magazines. This talent took him to Hollywood in 1955, where he became an apprentice film editor, working on animated cartoons like &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; and &quot;Gerald McBoing-Boing&quot;. Moving base and working at animation studios in New York and taking an apprenticeship as a recording engineer, Tod began to realise the potential of the sounds and effects he was working with, and experimented in creating works of musique-concrete. During this period of 1960 to 1965, Tod Dockstader spent all his spare time at Gotham Recording Studios, creating some of the most phenomenal music around. His early mono recordings were documented on an LP issued by New York's Folkway Records, and from thereon as the studio went on to get stereo equipment and more and more sound processing devices, the more radical and advanced the music became.",
                    "It's ironic really, that as a creative artist going from strength to strength, that upon moving to Canada and working upon the Montreal Expo 67, he lost the use of the studio he needed to be able to create his music. Obviously, it was unlikely he'd find anywhere else where he could work for hours on end, undisturbed and virtually at no cost. And, having no academic credentials in music, he was unable to secure work at any studio with advanced equipment. It was the end of a highly prolific but short-lived career, after which he returned to what he did originally: working in film production.",
                    "When stereo records were of adequate quality, the label Owl Records issued three LP's containing all of Tod Dockstader's major works. Although critically praised by some, on large these records went unnoticed at the time, but gradually over the years the word has spread about this remarkable sonic artist. Intrigued by electronic music, many have discovered and been surprised by his music. I first heard him via a tape recording of his phenomenal QUATERMASS album in the early-80's. But nowadays he's much quoted as an influence, and rightly revered for the creative genius he was, notably David Myers (aka Arcane Device) dedicated his early work to Tod Dockstader, and I doubt the soundworks of When, Zoviet France, or Nurse With Wound would have existed as such, if Tod Dockstader hadn't done the groundwork.",
                    "In explanation, Tod Dockstader has referred to his music generally as &quot;organised sound&quot; quoting Edgar Var&eacute;se, who he feels his early work is comparable to, though really his sonic creations became more like composed and orchestrated sound, precisely created with great care and attention.",
                    "EIGHT ELECTRONIC PIECES is a collection of Dockstader's earliest works in organised sound, actually as you'll gather quoting these as &quot;electronic&quot; pieces isn't really true, though such music couldn't really be created by any means but by electronic processing, although all the majority of the sound sources used are in fact all acoustic. It's amazing that this LP dates from 1961, only Pierre Schaefer and Pierre Henry had done extensive work in this genre, and Stockhausen was only just beginning to get to grips with this new technology. But, right from the start Tod Dockstader embraced the possibilities of the tape recorder: variable speeds, splicing, looping, echo, every technique that he could muster. The eight tracks show the roots of what he would develop further in more elaborate extensive excursions, and scarcely is the feel here as musical as what he went onto. Obviously there are shades of Var&eacute;se's Po&egrave;me &Eacute;lectronique and Pierre Henry's Voile d'Orphee, yet Dockstader had an individual style of dynamics, form and counterpoint, and could create the most spectacular and complex constructions. The likes of wind, rifle fire, water, jet engines, gongs, animals, vocal sounds, and much more, are the sources of Dockstader's creations, but only occasionally is anything recognisable. &quot;Organised sound&quot; is really too simple a definition, as such modest sources are turned into something spellbinding and so precisely executed. The culmination of all this also lead to creating works of complex composition, as opposed to the almost random cut and splice of his earliest experiments, Electronic Piece No. 8 was the first such excursion and it revealed a new side to Tod's creative prowess, that of a composer with a sense of dynamic, space and texture.",
                    "The two CD's released by Starkland catalogue his three albums on Owl Records along with some previously unreleased recordings.",
                    "Traveling Music (1960) is basically a revised and embellished stereo version of Electronic Piece No. 8 and is all the more rich and dynamic. But all the more revolutionary is Luna Park (1961), Tod's first work composed for stereo, named after the old Luna Park at Coney Island fun fair, it's a work with a plethora of sounds: laughing voices, all manner of percussive sounds, piano and electronic generator. A weird day at the fun fair perhaps!? When I first heard Ralph Lundsten and Leo Nilsson's early works (dating 1967-69) I thought they were remarkably advanced, but this evokes the same textures, power and humour, and is several years earlier. Two Fragments from Apocalypse (1961) are works that were originally omitted from the full Apocalypse suite. Kind of snapshots of ideas that were condensed into Apocalypse proper, they act as a more atmospheric prelude to the main work. Apocalypse (1961) itself is amongst the most frightening, intense, disturbing of Dockstader's works. Here the use of sounds is breathtaking: wailing cats, creaking doors, Gregorian choirs, explosions, screeching metal, almost every-thing spine tingling and strange. Probably the lest inspired title of all, Drone (1962) in fact offered a very different twist on his sound in that it implemented experimental use of guitar and piano amongst its sound sources, and with its stochastic rambling textures it's probably the closest Tod came to the sound of musique-concrete works by the likes of Pierre Henry, Luc Ferrari or Bernard Parmegiani.",
                    "In Water Music (1963) Tod created a work that went far in advance of Toru Takemitsu's Water Music of three years earlier, in twisting the sounds, with dextrous splicing, Tod attempted to create a music of violent water: liquid, solid and shattering ice-like textures, but he had to resort to cheating to get the effects he wanted, so he used related objects like drinking glasses, a Coke bottle and various objects to drop into water. With six parts in all Water Music is amongst the most seriously conceived of his works.",
                    "The ultimate Tod Dockstader creation however was the monu-mental 46 minute opus Quatermass (1964). Too long for an album originally, two of the surplus edited-out works made it onto the CD release as a bonus: Two Moons of Quatermass, these two 4 minute pieces offer a taster to the awesome power of Quatermass itself. To quote Tod himself 'Quatermass was intended, from the start, to be a very dense, massive, even threatening, work of high levels and energy' - it was pure coincidence that in Britain at the time there was a sci-fi TV series called &quot;Quatermass&quot;, as this would have made the ideal soundtrack. It's scarcely believable that virtually none of the sound sources are electronic, many of the textures are created by unlikely things like balloons, vacuum cleaner hoses, toys and the like, as well as the stable selection of percussive devices. This is dark nightmarish music, of great power and phenomenally dynamic execution, with astonishingly complex rhythmic and sequential passages, crescendos of such vigour, and use of stereo panning and bouncing that's far too dizzying to listen to on headphones.",
                    "Finally, as a bonus, is the previously unreleased Four Telemetry Tapes (1965), his very last work, and also his most truly electronic, it's an hybrid betwixt those 50's-60's electronic effects used in sci-films and early Cluster believe it or not, but still with those unique Dockstader characteristics.",
                    "To experience the music of Tod Dockstader is like entering another world, a musical world where the normal rules don't exist. What other music is still so challenging and fresh after thirty years? Very little!"

Dockstader was one of the few to master <em>musique concr&egrave;te</em>, the art of assembling tape-recorded sounds and painstakingly splicing, cutting, dubbing, manipulating and mixing to create final compositions.",
                    "If you think that sounds similar to the procedures used to create today's cutting-edge pop music, you're right. Three decades after Dockstader's work, musicians in the rap, house, and techno genres are using related techniques to create a new generation of aural collages - the main technical difference being the replacement of the industrial-age tape recorder with the computer age sampling keyboard.",
                    "Stylistically, though, much has changed. Whereas today's artists go for the beat and body, early practitioners of electronic music went for the mind. Dockstader's sonic landscapes are almost like a punkishly intellectual version of new age - music stripped of conventional notions of harmony and beat, and replaced with pure sound. His expansive, yet detailed, soundscapes would fit right into today's sci-fi film extravaganzas (and his work is also ripe for sampling and laying over dance grooves, however heretical that may seem to the &quot;old school&quot; of electronic musicians).",
                    "How does music created over thirty years ago retain its relevance? Part of the answer, of course, lies with the composer. To those familiar with <em>musique concr&egrave;te</em>, it is obvious that Dockstader's works were carefully assembled; there are no random bloops and bleeps here. The pieces flow, with the right balance of extended background sounds and short, percussive &quot;lead&quot; sounds. Well-executed craft always has a timeless quality.",
                    "Amazingly, however, some classicists still question the &quot;staying power&quot; of electronic music, despite its having been appropriated by rock groups in the 60s, jazz/fusion players in the 70s, and hip-hop/techno/rap artists in the 90s. Some want to know where the &quot;masterpieces&quot; are that will form the backbone of a standard repertoire, as exists in acoustic classical music. This misses the point completely. Early electronic music was generally a product of academia; a great deal of the experimental music of the 40s and 50s was essentially research and development. Like all experiments, some were failures but others have stood the test of time (in addition to Dockstader, pieces by Edgar Var&egrave;se, Pierre Henri, and Vladimir Ussachevsky come to mind). It is a testimony to the composers, not to a particular musical style, that music recorded decades ago with primitive techniques and equipment still matters today, and in some cases, sounds cutting-edge.",
                    "As you listen to these pieces, remember that the early tape music pioneers did not have digital technology, synthesizers, or samplers. Sounds were recorded on tape and manipulated by hand using razor blades, splicing blocks, and adhesive splicing tape, and often &quot;bounced&quot; from one machine to another to create overdubs (multitrack recorders were not available until much later). Techniques we take for granted today, such as automated mix-down, were but a dream. Sound generators consisted of recorded &quot;found sounds&quot; and equipment available at the time (primarily for broadcast use) such as test-tone oscillators and filters. Even echo units were a rarity; generally, tape recorders provided delays and other special effects.",
                    "Not just the equipment, but the compositional techniques were different too. Standard music notation was of little help, so the scores of that time were also experimental, and often used non-conventional symbols that meant something only to the composer. And of course, you couldn't go out and hire players to play your composition; it was completely a creature of the recording studio.",
                    "As you listen to the sounds on this CD, let your frame of reference wander back to a time when electronic sound represented a new frontier, before synthesizers filled the airwaves. There's a sense of discovery in Dockstader's works that remains vital today, and stands ready to inspire a new generation of audio collage makers.",

                    "Mostly, it was worse, as anybody might guess, back in the days when the tape recorder and its tricks were new, at least, in the U.S.A. Some of the dullest, most pompously silly tape sounds came from high places with full University blessings. I heard most of them and was even moved to satire in kind. But not all such art was silly - far from it. There were profound possibilities here, for someone who would be the right person to take them up. in my book, Dockstader was that man, following after the older Edgar Var&egrave;se, who ended his long radical career as a tape composer, just about as Dockstader was beginning his.",
                    "Long before tape, Var&egrave;se, coined the useful term &quot;organized sound&quot; to avoid that fruitless question, is it music? Wise thought, considering that Var&egrave;se came straight out of the most conventional French academic music training before his transplant to America! Dockstader's work is ever so specifically organized sound. Even more exactly, it is <em>musique concr&egrave;te</em>, a term out of Paris in WWII where for the first time recorded sounds were put together and dubbed back and forth on 78 rpm discs, an impossibly difficult and unsatisfactory medium but still a beginning. I heard some of these, brought back I think by Virgil Thomson after the liberation of Paris, still in mid-war.",
                    "The early tape music in this country was not exactly a success, and for good reason. It was radical, yes, but also uninteresting, to put it gently. Scorn was rampant and names to go with it. I remember, for instance, &quot;tapesichord music,&quot; malevolently concocted from the (then) maligned harpsichord and the scorned tape sounds. Who could listen to those endless, pretentious groans, grunts, hums and garbles of noise, sliding up and down drunkenly in pitch, minus any sense of rhythm, like no &quot;organized&quot; Mozart you ever heard! But better things were to come, much better, before the synthesizer slammed the entire movement to a halt.",
                    "The synthesizer, first in its Moog-type format (following an outlandish early RCA machine) and now triumphantly in digital, is undoubtedly a very major development in sonic techniques. Beside its amazing present versatility, the older <em>music concr&egrave;te</em> assemblage of real sounds is hopelessly out of date, even though some brave souls still continue to &quot;organize&quot; whale sounds and such in an effective way.",
                    "Few listeners realize the immense technical differences between these two approaches, though continuity is real enough. It is as the pencil to the word processor, the scratch pad to the laptop! Generational too: the synthesizer belongs to the computer age and to its people. But great things have come from pencils and scratch pads, so we marvel only briefly. Yes, synthesizers also use real sounds (as well as synthetic) but they are mostly stored as fragmented digital bits in memory, for instant recall and reprocessing into newly shaped sounds. Often the very same - but playable. The piano, for instance. You hear them every day. In comparison, the earlier organized sound was a handcrafted art. Indeed, a labor of love.",
                    "Thus, inevitably, <em>musique concr&egrave;te</em> is now mostly history - and there is its importance. The technique is obsolete, the sounds, at their best, are not. And so they return. One of the saving graces of an otherwise ever noisier and more meaningless audio world! Listen and enjoy.",

Dockstader does not even call the tapes he produces music, but rather organized sound - a term used by Var&#232;se. As an engineer he is skillful and aware. He chooses his sounds at will and is not bothered by any of the silly arguments that insist that all tones must be electronically produced, or that they should be organized according to any arcane formulae. He is not plagued by theory and, since he maintains that he is not a musician and in fact has never studied music, he is quite uninhibited in assembling taped sounds into a satisfactory organization. And in so doing he actually becomes a composer. The end result is, for the most part, really musical - more so at times than that assembled or composed by many of his more pretentious academic colleagues.",

Currently he is exposed on three LP discs released by a label new to me, Owl Records of Boulder, Colorado. On reviewing a single disc three years ago, I observed that a little of this can go a long way. But now with three LPs available, a lot seems to go much further. For Dockstader has continued to produce music - and I feel content in calling it that - that is quite absorbing, particularly when taken in adequate doses. At all times it is an innately musical assemblage reminding one of those produced by Alwin Nikolais, who maintains he is not a musician either, but a choreographer.",
                    "The titles of various works are suggestive, but not always highly relevant. One of the earliest examples, from 1961, is a piece - or organization - called Luna Park, which is in a conventional three-movement order with laughter which ranges from the silly to the sinister. Apocalypse, produced the same year, is a taped orchestral assemblage of bells, guns, chimes, wind, cats, drums, and the ragged voice of a sawtooth oscillator. Such a combination would have been a delight to that wonderfully gifted eccentric, William Billings, who in 1778 advocated that, in order to perform one of his pieces correctly, one should, &quot;Let an Ass bray the brass, let the filling of a saw carry the Tenor, let a hog who is extream hungry squeal the counter, and let a cart-wheel, which is heavy loaded and that has been long without grease, squeek the treble; and if the concert should appear to be too feeble you may add the cracking of a crow, the howling of a dog, the squalling of a cat; and... the rubbing of a wet finger on a window glass.&quot; Water Music, Dockstader's kitchen <em>La Mer</em>, is made of the superimposed sounds of drops of water in the kitchen sink. This is intended a drippy <em>tour de force</em>. Drone, an extended twelve-and-a-half minute piece, begins with the single germinal sound of a racing car, to which later are added the sounds of a guitar, since the car seemed to go only in circles. Both source sounds become transformed and varied, guitar glissandi approximating the Doppler effect of a passing motor. It is all most effectually handled and is quite evocative. Quatermass, a fifty minute work organized in 1964, is in five movements: &quot;Song and Lament&quot;, ;&quot;Tango&quot;, ;&quot;Parade&quot;, ;&quot;Flight&quot;, ;&quot;Second Song.&quot; The name Quatermass comes from Bernard Quatermass, a creation of Nigel Kneale and the hero of such films as <em>The Creeping Unknown</em>, which I regret I have not so far encountered. Dockstader came across the name, liked it, and later felt it quite appropriate for his work. As a composer in this vein - with science fiction as the background - Dockstader might make an impressive mark.",
                    "In an interview broadcast, Dockstader was asked whether his work is similar to an LSD experience: &quot;Taking someone into a world where he doesn't know what's going to happen, he doesn't know what he's going to see, what he's going to feel - he doesn't know anything about it - and the whole point is to go into this world and see what it's like, and to be receptive to anything it has to offer.&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, &quot;that's what you've got to start to do; but then you've got to come out alive and you've got to come out <i>with</i> something. It isn't enough just to go into it, you've got to come back with something under control.&quot; See what I mean?"

All too often this type of stuff ended up as a formless, self-serving noise collage, seldom able to make a real musical statement. Not so with Dockstader. The man's logic/aesthetic is unerring. For the first time in my experience with &quot;musique concrete&quot; I'm getting that emotional response I always feel when hearing a really very truly grand piece of music (hot damn!). A must for anyone who really cares about what they listen to (or at least would like to be able to terrorize their houseplants into submission once in a while).",

All that matters to the reader is that these recordings are available. I've already said some good things about Dockstader in my last review and, after hearing this batch of pieces, I run the risk of becoming an eternal raver. I think this guy is the finest composer who ever worked in the medium of sounds assembled on tape. The dramatic scope, careful attention to detail, and the sheer sonic artistry in creating a truly amazing aural world place these recordings with some of the all-time classics of music.",
                    "So what's on here? Well... the oldest work represented here, &quot;Travelling Music,&quot; was Dockstader's first venture into stereo. This is pretty important; as you listen to these pieces you soon realize that where the sound is coming from takes on enormous significance in both the micro and macro aural structure. This is one of the major elements working to create that &quot;animate&quot; feeling that comes in the best musics; the shift in caring from who the composer is and what he's doing, to what the sounds are doing, almost as if they're doing it on their own. And under headphones the effect is twice as intense. With the next piece, &quot;Luna Park,&quot; we hear Dockstader in full control of his concept and the means to execute it. Using basically only a couple of oscillators, some small bits of piano, and a lot of manipulated recordings of laughter, he manages to create a very fluid, yet classically-structured work (something missing in a lot of tape music of the period). Once again we hear just how good Dockstader is at the art of inevitability; the intuiting of the most precisely perfect sound, or perhaps &quot;quality,&quot; at any given moment. The final piece, &quot;Apocalypse,&quot; occupies all of side two. The structure is not quite so formal (apparent) as &quot;Luna Park,&quot; yet everything is still very tightly constructed. The sounds used are pretty varied but never unmanageable. Very reminiscent of the more doom-laden Art Bears stuff, or maybe a lyrical (?) SPK. Always restless and searching for the next step, the piece builds to a great hollow climax towards the end, taking leave with some of the loneliest feelings I've ever gotten off a record. Of course, I'm describing active listening here.",

The most hard-bitten audiophile, if he has a shred of taste to his name, soon tires of sonic thrills and chills. Never mind that the opening work, Traveling Music, rattles the dishes at my digs' far side: one cannot but hear in these Dockstader pieces flat-out <em>quality</em> if, that is, we accept music as organized sound and good music as sound organized in such a way as to seem larger (more meaningful, touching, or thrilling) than the sum of its parts. The high drama one perceives throughout this program is anything but serendipitous. Dockstader painstakingly assembled his sounds from sometimes unlikely materials: a cat-cry toy, for example, provides Apocalypse's baleful motif. As the reader probably knows, musique concrete consists for the most part of tape-recorded sounds processed, again for the most part, beyond recognition, the processing itself consisting of laborious operations replaced in time by software-driven computers. And yet, one is hard put in Dockstader's case to distinguish primitive handiwork from technologically swifter means.",
                    "I rank these pieces among the least dated I've heard as well as among the more engaging. Their freshness stems from Dockstader's understanding that electronic music, rather than ape nature and acoustic music's architecture and sonorities, must work at achieving its own voice and shape; at this Dockstader succeeds with flying colors, and the cliche I insist be taken as literal. Colors indeed fly in an obviously ordered but in no way fussed-over fashion. As annotator Craig Anderton observes, &quot;Well-executed craft always has a timeless quality.&quot; I propose in my review in this issue of two electronic works by Roger Reynolds that composers who work in purely electronic and electro-acoustic media ought to begin thinking seriously about making available to sympathetic discophiles CDs capable of multi-channel playback. Dockstader's obvious grasp of possibilities seems to me ideal for multi-channel presentation. Which brings us to - well, scarcely tragic, but a sad story certainly.",
                    "As I mentioned in my first Dockstader review, because he had no electronic-studio affiliations, in academe Dockstader was and remained a non-starter, i.e., a non-recipient of grants. After a stint at animated cartoons, he went to work for Gotham Recording in 1958 and there began collecting sounds on tape to experiment with. In 1960, having gained the use of a stereo Ampex deck, Dockstader revised an earlier work in mono, retitling it Traveling Music. His final Gotham after-hours production is Four Telemetry Tapes of 1965. And then he went on to other things. It's not that the man lies drunk and neglected in an alley next to E.A.Poe; he flourishes, the notes tell us, on the audio-visual side of the education business. It's clear to me, however, that had he institutional support, electronic music would be the richer for Dockstader's having stuck to his marvelous-sounding guns. I say so not from sentiment or sense of nostalgia. Luna Park, named after the Coney Island amusement park that burned in the early 40s, with its maniac-cackle motifs, is the disc's most instantly riveting work. The departing (and non-concrete) Four Telemetry Tapes, however, strike me as marvels of sophistication, subtlety, and energy. They're certainly among the small handful of electronic pieces I'd single out as masterworks.",

Here is Luna Park again, and it's even better than I remembered. The eerie altered laughing sounds are only a small part of the music, which is highly evocative throughout. (Luna Park was an amusement park in Coney Island.) I think this is one of the finest works of electronic music I've ever heard. The rest of the disc is not a let-down. Traveling Music, with its shelf-rattling bass, is quite compelling. I can understand why the Two Fragments from Apocalypse; were eliminated (because, Dockstader says, they didn't fit in), but I can also understand why he chose to keep them. Still, they are not as effective as Apocalypse itself, a four-movement piece with strong drama. Drone, fortunately, fails to live up to its title, although it has a bit less variety than the other music. All of these pieces date from 1960-62 and were previously issued on LP by Owl Records. Four Telemetry Tapes was completed in 1965 and has never been issued before. There seems to be less fat in this set, more sureness of purpose than in the previous works.

So do Beethoven's quartets, but we are more experienced at hearing the differences between them than we are with this music. But if you have adventurous ears, and particularly if you are attracted to electronic music, I recommend this disc very highly. Some aspects of Dockstader's music may seem primitive to our 1990s ears - what fun it would be to hear what he could do with contemporary digital equipment! - but there is always a strong musical intelligence making its presence felt throughout. You can't evaluate the sound quality of a disc like this, which doesn't reproduce anything, except to say that it's impressive and free from interference. Starkland's documentation is gratifyingly thorough, including the composer's illuminating comments on his music. Look out for a confusing typographical error on the back paper, which gives the disc's number as ST-201, the same as Starkland's previous Dockstader release."

                    "Water Music is a lively, elastic pulse of ever-shifting sonority and momentum. The bass response on this, and many of the other pieces, is downright phenomenal. These tapes clearly needed the CD format to fully convey their extended dynamic range. Two Moons of Quatermass consists of outtakes from the longer piece and is brooding and intense. The long Quatermass has more variety than most electronic music. In particular, the &quot;Tango&quot; section is a reference recording for bass. If your woofers can handle this without bottoming-out, they're doing their job (<em>GL was astonished when he heard this track. That avowed LP junkie immediately set about obtaining a copy of the CD.</em>) Travelling Music represents Dockstader's art in its most basic form. This composition was made for two-track tape from only a few sound sources. Dockstader's imaginative use of pace and channel-to-channel &quot;travelling&quot; is polished and intuitive. Luna Park uses the sounds of laughter to create a rich sonic landscape of mood that the composer describes as &quot;silly, sad, and simple.&quot; Apocalypse and the shorter Two Fragments from Apocalypse are something entirely different. Here Dockstader conjures a darker, less optimistic sound world. Apocalypse, Part Three, with its cries and tolling intensity, is especially disturbing. Drone is a more conventional study in long tones, and the final Four Telemetry Tapes uses almost entirely electronically generated sound sources.",
                    "This music certainly won't appeal to every listener, but the sympathetic appreciator with an awareness of the genre is apt to be bowled over. The audiophile, regardless of aesthetic preference, will also likely be amazed at the technical properties of the recordings. Herein lies material to test both systems to their limits; this stuff engages the hardware and the brain."

Today, in the wake of dub's aural cut-ups and 'Ardkore Techno's relentless info blitzes, Dockstader's use of <em>musique concr&egrave;te's</em> cut'n'splice editing and disorientating tape manipulations should sound less daunting than when they first appeared. But his micro-amplifications of balloon exhalations, water drops and adhesive tape, although seemingly innocuous propositions, still insinuate nightmarish stories. His aural chaos theories were made real by painstakingly overdubbing the screams, scrapes and swells detected by close miking. Rejecting the shock treatments characteristic of electroacoustic music, and drawing on his studies of psychology and cartoon soundtracks, Dockstader demonstrated a commitment to tension as a means of creating sonic suspense. His work was aimed at the mind as opposed to today's musical fascination with the body.",

This stirring of subconscious horrors is as startling as it is oppressive; an insular voyage impossible to forget. The obsessive care with which Starkland have compiled and presented these extraordinary recordings should ensure that Dockstader will be remembered as the innovative, visionary figure he undoubtedly was."

Born in 1932, this American composer started out studying painting and film making. By 1955 he was combining sound with images and working on some cartoons. In 1958, working as a sound engineer in a commercial recording studio, during off hours he made himself a collection of sounds, and began to try doing <em>musique concr&egrave;te</em> which he had heard about on the radio. He prefers the term &quot;organized sounds&quot; from Edgar Var&#232;se's <em>organisation sonore</em>, for it short circuits questions like &quot;Is it still music?&quot; His organized sounds are mainly acoustic in origin, but Tod DOCKSTADER also uses some oscillators, a kind of early ancestor of synthesizers. &quot;A worker in rhythms, frequencies, and intensities.&quot;",
                    "Apocalypse (1961) and Quatermass (1964) to me have a place as veritable references, notably for his work with space, most astonishing for the time. Each of his compositions is different, accentuating in one case detail, in another mass, in a third huge ranges of volume. In Luna Park, from the name of the amusement park, he plays with recorded laughter; in Four Telemetry Tapes, three test-tone generators furnish the sounds, recorded on tape in minuscule bits to create weird rhythms. Two CDs you should urgently get to discover an unrecognized, forgotten composer from a country where there has never really been a <em>musique concr&egrave;te</em> school. Now when will they reissue some work by Ilhan Mimaroglu?"

Dockstader was born in 1932 in St.Paul, Minnesota. The booklet tells us Tod can be seen as one of the founders of real &quot;electronic music.&quot; In 1958, he apprenticed as a recording engineer at Gotham Recording, after working as an apprentice film editor for animated cartoons, including &quot;Mr. Magoo&quot; and &quot;Gerald McBoingBoing&quot;. At this major commercial studio, Dockstader used off-work hours to collect interesting sounds and to experiment with &quot;musique concrete.&quot; After a lot of experimenting, he had built these sounds into his first &quot;Eight Pieces.&quot; Fragments of these early works were even used by Fellini in his film &quot;Fellini Satyricon&quot;... In 1960, the first stereo devices became available, and Dockstader revised some previous sounds into his first stereo piece, called Travelling music. And that's the first track on this CD. With only a two-track recorder, gong, one test generator, jet plane, metal plate, metal bowl, voice, hollow tube and adhesive tape (!!), he created a magnificent piece of music, that still retains its relevance after thirty years. It's all very cool and rather empty music, but it has a frightening impact beyond imagination.",
                    "When I was listening to this CD, I had difficulty believing that these recordings were actually made before I even was born! I can imagine that people who heard Dockstader's music in the early 60s were more than confused... This is a release which contains not only very interesting sounds, but is also a must for electronic lovers, since this is one on the backbones of modern experimental music. TIP ! (There is also another Dockstader-CD available, so request for the free Starkland-catalog!)"
