## Reviews

When Owl first released the LPs, there were only a few reviews, including the one reproduced here from the *Saturday Review*, which at the time was one of  the leading mainstream, general interest (*Dockstader?*) magazines in the U.S. When Thomas Steenland took over Owl in the late '70s, he got some new exposure for the LPs, which resulted in two reviews appearing in *OP* (which later evolved into *Option*, which reviewed the CDs) around 1981. One of the first reviews of the Starkland CDs was by Joe McLellan, then the main critic of *The Washington Post*, who turned out to be a Dockstader fan. There have been about 30 positive reviews of the CDs since they were released - reproduced here are two from *Fanfare*, and others from *Stereophile*, *The Wire*, *Revue et Corrigee* (France), and *Audioview* (Belgium).
