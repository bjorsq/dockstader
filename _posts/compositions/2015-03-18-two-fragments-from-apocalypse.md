Two Fragments from Apocalypse, like the [Two Moons of Quatermass]({% post_url compositions/2015-03-18-two-moons-of-quatermass %}), were "thrown out" from the main work as it cooled and contracted (over a period of months of editing the mixes). Most "outs" end up on the floor, in ankle-deep snarls of tape, and, at the end of the day, are gathered to The Lord (in a wastebasket). But, sometimes, whole blocks have to come out because, though they're good, they're hurting the forward motion of the piece: they're Digressions (I digress a lot, because I push in a lot of directions when I'm making a piece - of music or of writing). But in these cases I save them, and after the main work is complete, go back and see if they can stand alone as pieces themselves. So I hack away at them, and sometimes they just vanish: the razor blade reduces them into nothing - which tells me they weren't pieces in the first place. These two held up under the Blade.

**First**
