Coming soon to an interwebz near you!
=====================================

I've been working with legendary electronic composer Tod Dockstader for the last year, trying to write his life story and uncover the mysteries of his as-yet-unreleased late works. The first phase of this work is the short documentary seen above. This site will eventually feature extensive biographical information, new short (or perhaps not-so-short) documentaries as they get produced, rare photos, cartoons Tod drew in college, podcasts (Todcasts!), music, and more. Be sure to check back often as new things get added.
