What Tod means to me
====================

Got something to say about Tod Dockstader's music? Here's the place you can do it. Anyone is welcome to submit a video, audio, or written essay explaining what Tod's music means to them. Talk about when or where you first heard Tod's music, your initial reaction, what your favorite piece is, how he has influenced your work, or anything else you can think of. If you have the ability to record your own video or audio essay simply send it to me at musicforinternets@gmail.com If you are in or visiting the New England area it's possible that we can make arrangements to film an interview.

Here's the first installment of the series featuring Wobbly, who was in the area for a few performances.
