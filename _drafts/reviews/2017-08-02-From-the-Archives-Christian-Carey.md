Composer and electronic musician **Tod Dockstader** died in 2015 and dementia truncated his work in the electronic studio even before that. However, he left behind over 4200 unreleased sound files. **Justin H. Brierley** has compiled the best of these into a selection of pieces _From the Archives_ that **Starkland** has released on CD.

The collection is compelling. It is clear that Dockstader’s remaining work wasn’t unfinished snippets. Rather, these are compositions that gel seamlessly, like the sonorous _Super Choral_ and ceremonially percussive _Chinese Morf_. While many of these pieces seem deadly in earnest, elsewhere there is also the characteristic playfulness with sound for which Dockstader is well known. I’m particularly fond of the layering of bells, unpitched percussion, creaking steps, and static bursts on _Anat Fort_ and the thrumming and scraping of _Big Jig; Mystery Creak_ and _Creak Creek_ further this exploration of electroacoustic sounds at play. _Todt 1_ and _Todt 2_ work with shimmering overtones and what sounds like rockets preparing for liftoff. _Piano Morf_ is the most epic-scaled of the included pieces and features a plethora of sounds, both pianistic and fantastic in inspiration. All in all, it proves to be a most suitable valediction for an imaginative creator. _From the Archives_ suggests that even Dockstader’s backup files are well worth taking to heart.
